Just like traditional advertising, digital advertising consists of pay for announces or messages to promote your website or businesses in different digital mediums like Search Engines and Social Networks. 

Google Ads is a PPC or a pay per click system created by Google in 2000, to leverage the power of their Search Engine.

That is to say that for every click or visitor in your website you can get money. And this work is easier and possible using Google Ads as a tool, not like a vendor or a magician who attracts people. 

We consider those are enough reasons for using and taking advantage of Google Ads. 

<title-2>Now I do. The tips to create effective campaigns in Google Ads</title-2>

**1. Have a clear goal and the content strategy**

As we said in our previous post about [planning of a ads](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Planning-your-ads-campaign-on-10-steps/), you can have a content strategy and define goals to achieve through your ads campaign, in this case, Google Ads campaigns. 

All the ads, images, videos, and messages you are going to use for your campaigns will come from there. 

If you know where you are going, and what content you plan to use based on those objectives and your audience, everything else will come in addition. 

**2. Keep in mind all characteristic of your audience**

Write to them, basically. At this point, you must know all the characteristics and the whole profile of your potential customers.  

So, keep in mind this segmentation and all preferences of them at the time of writing the content of your ads. 

The main goal is to attract the attention of who reads or sees the ad, raise their interest, convince them that they desire your product or service, and finally but no less important, give them satisfaction when viewing your ad and visiting your website or your social media accounts as the destination. 

**3. Use negative keywords**

But first, what are they? When you create a Campaign you must specify to Google Ads with which keywords or terms he is going to relate your ads to display it when people search for those terms, as the search engine has millions of searches every second, Google Ads, by using [Artificial Intelligence](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-in-2018/) starts to relate those initial terms that you provided with similar terms, to try to display your ad to more people that are interested in your message but that they do not necessarily use the exact same words that you provide. This process expands your terms broadly, so Negative keywords are keywords that you specifically tell Google Ads to not to use in this expansion process.

Thanks to these words you can rationalize your campaigns. Showing your ads in more relevant search result pages. 

These negative keywords also can be optimized. Specifically, on Google Ads, you can specify which keywords are not good and which they are for your specific ads or for the whole campaign. In this way, you can focus better on the needs of qualified customers and also it helps you to save money showing your ad on keyword searches not related to the main goal or customer. 

Negative keywords are highly beneficial for your campaigns on Google Ads. 

“ For example, one of my clients is an apartment management company in Virginia that owns several off-campus student apartment complexes. These apartments are made for students and are not conducive to the needs of traditional families. To ensure they only receive qualified traffic, I excluded general terms like “family” along with “cheap” and other qualifiers to negate traffic from people who were not in their demographic.”

**4. Target the content of your ads too**

Believe it or not, the content of the ad can also be segmented very specifically in Google Ads. For example, you would use three types of keyword targeting which can be the exact match, phrase match, or broad match in your targeting strategy. 

Bet for exact match keywords and less for broad match keywords, and also, separate ad groups by keyword type, in addition to the category, for keeping the campaign well organized.

"Google's targeting criteria," says Joy Gendusa, founder, and CEO of PostcardMania, postcard marketing experts. For example, you can use geo-targeting to have your ads run in a particular geographic area.”

**5. Be sure of mobile-preferred ads**

Personalized messages for mobiles.

This will work better if you have a landing page optimized for mobile or a responsive website. And as a result, you would bring a better experience to each customer that visits your site and also this would represent a higher conversion rate. 

**6. Test your ads**

Once you have thought about and structured your entire Google Ads campaign, we recommend that you do small tests to be sure that the results you are going to obtain are the best. 

Test the keywords, the copy you will use, the design of the page, among others. 

And if it is necessary to change your ad and get the best [click-through rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate), the lowest cost per click, the highest number of conversions.

**7. Follow the conversion tracking**

This is a kind of optimization of future campaigns. If you notice than determined keywords are more effective than others, and you achieve higher sales or conversion rates with certain content strategies you should use them more or make the most of it on future occasions. To know this information is necessary to track the conversions of each Google Ads campaigns that you are doing. 

One tool to do this is Google Analytics. This is a tool for analyzing the traffic that is coming to your website and can be connected with Google Ads to track specific actions of a user on your website and figure out which users are doing what you want them to do, example: fill a form, click on a specific link or action, etc. That way you can analyze which ad or campaign is being more effective.

**8. If there's a change to be made in the campaign, do it**

Taking into consideration that you can change the setting of the campaign before and during the campaign exposure, you have the possibility to make any change you consider necessary to enhance the results. 

For example: “pausing keywords and ads with low click-through rates, lowering keyword bids if a campaign is hitting daily budget limits and adding new versions of the copy if ads are underperforming."

**9. Get the most out of Google's Remarketing feature**

The remarketing is a feature from Google Analytics. You have to configure it correctly.  We can explain it better in a later post that we will make where we plan to talk exclusively of Google Analytics and how you can to make the most of this valuable tool. 

For the moment, we can say you that the remarketing tool has lists leverages Google's big data capabilities that give you the opportunity to track who has visited your website by any means, including Google Ads, and identifies who is statistically most likely to be converted. All of this, is done automatically by these tools for you so that you can use this information again in your campaigns.

**10. Ad as many extension you consider important**

Extensions on Google Ads are really useful. Extensions are features that permit us to add more information to the advertisements that might be relevant to our potential customers. And all of that, without cost. 

These features make more complete your ad. And some examples of extensions are the next:
