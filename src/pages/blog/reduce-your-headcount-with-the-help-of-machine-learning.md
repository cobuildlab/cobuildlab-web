As Robert Downey Jr says in the video, this is the most answered question by google nowadays. People are afraid in front of the possibility of losing their work as a result of digital transformation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Here we are not giving them an answer, but, we’ll introduce you to a million growth opportunities that **machine learning** (in specific) brings to your business logistics.

<title-2>Machine learning is:</title-2>

<Br>
  
Machine learning is the automated learning capability of a machine without being specifically programmed for that. 

This technology is part of Artificial Intelligence options available from many years ago. And now, it's been perfected thanks to big data and all advances in recollecting storage and data management.

A software development team and engineers create algorithms that improve themselves through time. 

This technology involves other advances and tools such as:

**Robotics**

**Self-driving vehicles** 

**Process automation** 

**Virtual reality and augmented reality**

**Optical recognition, and so on.**

<title-2>What we can see on the video that’s applicable to your business on logistics and supply chain</title-2>

The best of machine learning is that it turns supply chain and logistics development more efficient, safer, cleaner, and productive.

These companies (on the video) show us how technology helps to improve processes and make companies evolve. 

And to answer the main question of this post, machine learning perfectly matches the human environment. Actually, making it better. 

The goal is perfection in all industries’ processes and even real-life: machines plus humans not machines instead of humans. 

What happens, in this case, is technology and machine learning devices transforming jobs and processes into their better version. 

Let’s talk about the examples we saw!

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tusimple.com/">  TuSimple and self-driving trucks </a></title-3>

Driving is a mix of abilities. Machines now have almost all of them except common sense, and that's when humans come into play

Land transportation of goods is not a simple job. It requires lots of hours behind the wheel, without mentioning the typical risks of being on a highway. 

Self-driving trucks enter the scenario to complement this high-risk job position, making it more simple and safer. Saving the driver’s efforts. 

If we can do something to make this activity less complicated for companies and people, why don’t we try it? 

For now, people are testing and teaching <a href="https://www.profitableventure.com/start-box-truck-business/" target="_blank">truck machines</a> to self-drive better every day. Do you think is it possible? We’ll see.

<title-3>Port of Long Beach, California has the first fully-automated container-terminal</title-3>

<Br>
  
In this busy port machines and people coexist in a safe environment. 

Every day tons of goods and containers arrive, leave, and are moved from one place to another. 

In general, logistics processes are challenging jobs for people, companies, and operators, and that is why the support of robots and machines with machine learning algorithms makes the work more bearable, effective, and, above all, safe. 

The workers involved in the processes comment that they do not see the machines as a threat. On the contrary, they believe they’re a complement. 

Although the machine environments are a no-man zone (at least in this industry), they are controlled remotely by a team that has the experience and common sense to carry out the daily tasks. 

The way of working is evolving and jobs require other types of skills. 

Technologies as optical character recognition, remote controls, and robots are part of daily processes in this port.

This perfect match is possible with artificial intelligence and of course custom software development.

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://robohub.org/">  RoboHub </a> on Waterloo University are machine learning pioneers</title-3>

<Br>
  
Robotics has evolved a lot in our country and Asia. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bostondynamics.com/">  Boston Dynamics </a> is a clear example of how agile robots can be. But what if we go one step further?

Allow robots to perceive reality and interpret it as we do. Without codes that tell them to do so, or how to act. 

They are humanoids that we can use for the development of our daily activities, but especially in commercial, industrial, and production processes. 

It is a safer alternative, where people and machines work in a much safer environment. 

Managing features like computer vision augmented reality, and high tech and quality cameras. 

As you can see in the video, this initiative continues in development and improvement but sooner than later it will be a reality and our logistics and industries employees will love it because the work process will never be the same (and for good).

<title-3>Zume Pizza changing the supply chain management with AI</title-3>

<Br>
  
The big problem of supply chains nowadays is producing too much and having lots of wastes or deficiencies for bad calculations.

Have you ever thought that the planet's waste could be improved by incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning into our supply chain to balance it and always work with just enough? 

In the video, we can see this case with a pizzeria in Los Angeles, but it is an opportunity and a wake-up call to all service and industrial companies and those who need supplies to carry out their production processes (basically all of them). 

And this not only helps the planet and its health, but it avoids governments and citizens spending so much money to get rid of waste, and saving resources intelligently, because input process, use, and loss of supplies would be regulated by the machines. They are better at calculating needs than we humans are. 

In the example, we see machine learning to try and forecast how much pizza people want, what kind, and when by crossing data of location, day of the week, weather, what’s on tv,  and past ordering trends. That’s insane! But useful. The best of technology working in favor of companies. This project mixes big data efforts with machine learning. 

And this company made the dream that many futuristic movies showed. They are robots cooking hand in hand with humans. 

It’s AI plus humans. 

Although this company continues to improve, and they had their stumble last year with robots preparing pizza, their CEO, Alex Garden states that he knows it will change the world, he will keep trying another time, and although humans are the ones preparing the pizzas today, they still use supply calculation to their advantage to maintain a balance in their supply chain and decrease waste. 

Are you ready to be the next pioneer in this field? Those who dare to take the first steps in the industries usually make history and can make a significant change. **Machine learning** is here to stay and continue to support the production, logistics, and supply chain processes of companies around the world. Our team at Cobuild Lab is ready to develop software in this area and be part of the improvement of your company. Contact us and let's start the project.
