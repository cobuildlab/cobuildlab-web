Fact: There's no place like Miami. The “Magic City” boasts a unique and exciting mix of hip urban culture, latin vibes, and all sorts of fun things to do and interesting places to visit, but most of all <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Miami-a-Tech-Hub-for-investors/"> Miami is the perfect Tech Hub for Investors</a>. </br></br>

You know we like to think about Miami as the next Silicon Valley, and why is that? Well, maybe because it is the second most entrepreneurial city in the U.S. according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://indicators.kauffman.org/"> Kauffman Index</a>. And that’s why on this segment we are going to talk about some very promising Miami-based Startups. </br></br>

Today we present to you a company that started about ten years ago but whose product has immeasurably improved the health industry. Ranked #28 on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/carecloud/#230218f7624b"> Forbes 'Most Promising Companies'</a> list in 2014, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.carecloud.com/"> CareCloud Corp.</a> has become one of the fastest-growing players in the electronic health records business. </br></br>

CareCloud provides cloud-based practice management, electronic health record and medical billing software and services to medical groups. </br></br>

While many large hospital systems and multispecialty practices still opt for proprietary electronic medical systems that they can control in-house, Internet-based “cloud” systems are the fastest-growing segment of the market. They are especially attractive to young physicians accustomed to doing work through websites and smartphones. </br></br>

Convinced that the US healthcare system had become overly complex and dysfunctional, Albert Santalo, an engineer and serial entrepreneur, founded CareCloud in 2009. </br></br>

<block-quote>“It’s this big broken industry, and we feel a lot of the problems can be solved by better information technology” - Albert Santalo.</block-quote> </br></br>

Care Cloud has a workflow engine that helps physicians eliminate all those things that make their practice inefficient, such as wasteful processes and redundant testing, which have historically caused healthcare costs to skyrocket. </br></br>

Santalo and his team of engineers created a system that is as easy to use as any website, with an eye-pleasant design and multitasking support. We can tell that they made the user experience the main key to their software development strategy. </br></br>

He is the former Chairman and CEO of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.carecloud.com/"> CareCloud </a>, a company he founded in 2009 with the goal of modernizing the outdated US healthcare industry with a cloud-based platform, Alberto has since moved on to other ventures including being part of the founding team for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.8base.com/"> 8base</a>, a Miami-based SaaS back-end platform. </br></br>

This Electronic Medical Records software balances flexibility with ease of use, allowing you to customize templates, save your frequent orders for labs and prescriptions, and enter data through multiple methods. Although EMR software can often be overwhelming due to its complexity, CareCloud organizes information in a way that is easily digestible and intuitively navigated which makes it a timesaver and a game changing tool for physicians. </br></br>
