Companies around the world are struggling with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> supply chain </a> bottlenecks as the post-pandemic surge in demand converges with industrial production trying to catch up after long Covid-induced shutdowns. 

In 2021, the global pandemic affected the ball <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/IoT-in-supply-chain-management/"> supply chain </a>, and some companies are still struggling to recover. Here are some of the **supply chain issues** they faced in 2021. 

<br>

<title-2>Some supply chain issues and challenges in 2021</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>**Increasing freight prices:**</title-3>

<br>

The need for forwarding has increased significantly since before the pandemic and over the past year. Whether by sea, air, or land,  no version of forwarding had been able to escape this reality. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Must-know-4-Essential-Steps-you-Must-Know-and-Do-to-Improve-Your-Product-Delivery/">  Shipments and deliveries </a> have risen sharply thanks to the high demand caused by the isolation restrictions. 

<br>

<title-3>**Material scarcity:**</title-3>

<br>

Insufficient supplies have been a concern since the pandemic began due to a surge in consumer demand like never before. 

Companies and suppliers alike are struggling to meet this demand amid the limited availability of many parts and materials. A recent survey by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) revealed: "record lead times, large-scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising raw material prices, and difficulties in forwarding products across industries." 

<br>

<title-3>**Getting value from data:**</title-3>

<br>

Upgrading to digital and intelligent data analytics has been a hurdle for many supply chain companies in recent years, but the potential value of resources such as machine learning is more significant than ever. 

The more technology integration you have throughout the value stream, the more data you generate - you can let that data languish unused, or you can turn it into more accurate forecasts, predictions, and process improvements than ever before. 

Getting valuable information from this data across the entire chain is a Herculean task, but it can be made easier with the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> help of technology </a>.

<br>

<title-3>**Achieving digital transformation:**</title-3>

<br>

There are several technologies with the potential to improve the way we approach the traditional supply chain, including artificial intelligence, drones and robots, electric vehicles, and on-demand delivery. But while these systems/services are designed to make eCommerce processes more efficient and profitable in the long run, the challenge is to ensure that each tool can be adapted to any existing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Supply-chain-synchronization/"> supply chain</a> and that they are scalable and flexible to adjust to the current market changes.

<br>

<title-3>**Port congestion:**</title-3>

<br>

Port congestion caused by the pandemic remains one of the significant challenges for the world's supply chains as port owners, forwarders, and shippers continue to struggle to find a workable solution to this problem collectively. Congestion occurs when a ship arrives at a port but cannot load (or unload) because that station is already at capacity. 

Although the loading/unloading process usually goes according to plan, labor shortages and social alienation associated with the pandemic have significantly thrown it off course, creating significant bottlenecks at several busy docks.

<br>

<title-3>**Changing consumer attitudes:**</title-3>

<br>

Consumer attitudes and behaviors have also significantly altered during the pandemic, such as lowering the threshold for lead times and increasing requirements for a positive customer experience. 

The challenge is to have an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/7-reasons-to-make-a-supply-chain-agile-and-resilient-with-robotic-process-automation/"> agile supply chain </a> that can harness the power of automation to optimize fulfillment and handle accelerated demand with ease. An excellent example of this supply chain flexibility comes from a multichannel order fulfillment service and inventory management software. 

The pandemic drove <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/custom-software-development-facilitates-logistics-for-e-commerce/"> e-commerce </a> demand to an all-time high. While the increase in order volume was a boon for merchants, new infrastructure requirements and supply chain disruptions were significant points of concern and a consequent focus for customers.

Supply chains are the lifeblood of most businesses today. Keeping all supply chain components running ensures that your company can provide on-time delivery of products and services. 

All of these problems can be improved or solved by implementing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> digitization throughout your supply chain </a>. If you don't know where to start, you can contact us, and we will help you with your entire **supply chain issues**.
