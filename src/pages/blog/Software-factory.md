Miami, FL. November 27, 2022

In today's brutally competitive <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/digital-transformation-5-trends-to-pay-attention-to-in-2022/">   digital </a> economy, organizations must transform into software-driven enterprises, becoming digital innovation factories that can quickly and efficiently create and distribute new <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   digital services </a>. This enables them to be resilient, agile, and innovative, creating business value and responding to market changes and customer needs. This year the software industry has taught us a lot, but for 2023 great things await us, and we must be prepared to face them. Here we show you a little more about some of the pillars of a **software factory** in 2023:

<br>

<title-2>What is a software factory?</title-2>

<br>

A software factory is a structured collection of related software assets that helps produce <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/web-development/">   computer software applications </a> or software components according to specific requirements defined externally by the end user through an assembly process. Software factories are generally engaged in the creation of <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/staff-augmentation-vs-project-outsourcing/">   outsourced software </a>. 

Today, to deliver better customer experiences at unprecedented speed and scale, companies need entirely different skills, tools, and processes. Software factories are driven by four core principles: agility, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/process-automation/">   automation </a>, information analytics, and <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/security-compliance/">   security </a>. They deliver a quality experience, protect sensitive data, respond quickly to market needs, and create operational software anytime, anywhere.

* **Planning:** The planning phase must go beyond standard project planning and encompass higher-level elements, such as establishing strong collaboration between business and technology leaders, shared KPIs, and making informed decisions about software architectures, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Top-6-reasons-to-learn-How-to-code/">   languages </a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Mobile-App-Development-Frameworks/">   application frameworks </a>. 

Entrepreneurial developers should remember that it is easier for companies to develop their custom software and gradually adapt it to their needs over time than to have a limited, off-the-shelf option that only partially meets their needs.

**Recommendations:**

1. Approach planning as a continuous function, not as something to do once to kick off a project. For example, you should base your decisions on KPIs and continually tweak those KPIs as needed.

2. Think about future distribution plans. After building a software-driven product, continuously consider how to drive new business value through new distribution methods to share it more widely, such as via open <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/ideas-to-take-advantage-of-APIs-from-other-platforms-to-generate-useful-software-tools/">   APIs </a> or edge deployments. 

3. Constantly evaluate how new technologies can change your assessment to build vs. buy your business applications.

* **Sourcing:** Enterprises should expect their applications to be heterogeneous, written in various languages, and composed of open source components, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/custom-software-development/">   custom code </a>, commercial software, internally re-used code, and more.

People are turning to these different languages, technologies, and open-source packages because they offer flexibility and allow for better and more quickly developed products. Still, of course, there are challenges involved as well.

**Recommendations:**

1. Understand the transitive dependencies of your applications via a software bill of materials (SBOM).

2. Avoid legal and licensing risks by ensuring no OSS licensing violations or restrictive licensing terms, such as copyleft.

3. Store curated OSS in an internally managed, version-controlled, and curated package repository. This ensures that developers take authorized copies of components and provides another level of tracking for OSS used in your applications.

* **Develop:** <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/hire-remote-software-developers/">   Developers </a> are adopting new technologies, practices, and approaches to increase their agility and accelerate their <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/app-development/">   application development processes </a>, as well as their ability to respond to end-user feedback. Among the essential tools and techniques are microservices-based architectures, automation, cloud-native technologies, and DevSecOps, among others. Entrepreneurs must consider all these technologies and development tools to find and assemble their team, a team with the competencies and skills necessary to create products that align with the market and technological progress.

**Recommendations:**

1. Adopt modern cloud-native application architectures and DevOps methodologies to improve agility and velocity.

2. Leverage DevSecOps to shift security to the left and catch vulnerabilities before production.

3. Utilize the ephemeral nature of containers and a full-featured container registry to speed up application delivery and deployment 

Designing and executing the entire <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/digital-transformation/">   digital transformation </a> lifecycle is a complex process and requires a holistic approach. Organizations aiming for a successful digital transformation must work simultaneously on many fronts: they must define their digital objectives, talk to their customers and employees about the change, consider their suppliers and partners, and critically assess the shortcomings of their legacy systems. 

In addition, issues and challenges related to integrating new <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-using-productivity-tools-in-your-business/">   digital tools </a> and technologies, measuring and analyzing results, and reviewing results must also be deliberated in detail to transform the enterprise truly digitally.

For this 2023, the **software factory** has a big task and will be in a highly competitive environment; entrepreneurs must be aware of many flanks and, in all, must respond.
