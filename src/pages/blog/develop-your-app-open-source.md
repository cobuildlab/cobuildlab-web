Miami, FL. July 06, 2022

When <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   you develop software </a>, the idea is that everyone can use it. It's also expected that your community wants to suggest some improvements. 

A way of doing it is through satisfaction surveys, but the easiest is developing an open-source <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/software-open-source-vs-proprietary-software/">   app </a>. How does it work? Below we introduce you. 

Please choose the right team to do it, but first, let us explain some facts about open-source benefits.  

Entrepreneur, you will love this! Then you **develop your app open-source!**

<br>

<title-2>What is an open-source app?</title-2>

<br>

Open-source refers to something that people can modify and share because its design is publicly available. 

Open-source software is distributed with its source code, making it available for use, modification, and distribution with its original rights. The source code is the part of the software that most users never see; it is the code that programmers manipulate to control the behavior of a program or application.

Programmers who access the source code can modify a program by adding it, changing it, or fixing parts that don't work correctly. It usually includes a license that allows programmers to modify the software to suit their needs better and control how the software can be distributed.

Today, open-source designates a broader set of values, what we call the open-source way. 

Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate the principles of open sharing, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-driven development.

<title-2>Myths of developing an open-source app</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>❌Open-source software is of inferior quality:</title-3>

<br>

 Although open-source projects thrive on public contributions, all pull requests are evaluated and accepted by the project managers. 

Donations are thoroughly tested and approved. The flexibility of its license does not determine the quality of software. 

Open source projects boast a global community of developers who can contribute to solving big problems and constantly <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Must-know-4-Essential-Steps-you-Must-Know-and-Do-to-Improve-Your-Product-Delivery/">   improving the product. </a>

<br>

<title-3>❌<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/facebook-open-source-software/">   Open-source </a> is less secure than proprietary software:</title-3>

<br>

This is the most common misconception people have. They believe that exposing source code to the public will expose vulnerabilities. But the concept of openness is, in fact, one of the greatest strengths of open source. 

Giving developers access to source code helps them find and resolve security issues much faster with the support of open forums and issue queues, unlike proprietary software where the vendor must be trusted to come along and release an update or update or a patch.

In contrast, the reality is that hackers don't need access to the code studio to hack the software. They need access to the right hacking tools that automatically detect vulnerabilities.

<br>

<title-3>❌Beating the competition:</title-3>

<br>

In software, ideas are cheap. Value is almost always created in the execution of ideas. When you share your opinions with the world, it frees your brain to focus on what matters most. Instead of worrying about contractors or partners, you can focus on iterating faster. 

You'll probably be surprised how the open-source community responds to your openness.

<br>

<title-3>❌Open-source is not compatible with proprietary programs:</title-3>

<br>

Most open-source enterprise software runs on proprietary operating systems (iOS or Microsoft Windows) and is open-source. 

Open-source software implements the same open industry standards that enable interoperability as proprietary software. In some cases, open-source software will integrate with other systems even better than proprietary systems.

<br>

<title-3>❌Open-source is difficult to maintain:</title-3>

<br>

This misconception is an outcome of the previous one. On the contrary, there is always active motivation and contribution to the opensource projects. Moreover, there are plenty of open-source <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   project management tools </a> to aid in maintaining code and keeping it well documented and traceable.

<br>

<title-3>❌Winning in the market:</title-3>

<br>

If you're in a call with a vast (and growing) TAM worth pursuing, it's unlikely to be a winner-take-all situation. The first lesson is to find a user segment that you can surprise and then iterate like crazy. Every second you spend on your competitors is time you could spend improving your product or your team. If a competitor forks your open-source project and can outperform you, then I'd say you were destined to lose that particular race anyway.

<br>

<title-3>❌There is less support for open-source software:</title-3>

<br>

In the mid-1990s, when open-source software first appeared on the scene, developers had to rely on the community and other users for support. 

Today, third-party support for open source software is commonplace. With open-source software, an entrepreneur or startup can always turn to an independent third party for assistance and advice rather than waiting for the proprietary vendor to deal with a problem they may have.

<title-2>Benefits of developing an open-source app</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Open source is widely used:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/">   Finding developers with expertise </a> in a particular project can be much easier since these projects are widely used and known. In addition, developers prefer to work in open-source companies because they know that they will not be locked into a proprietary solution and that their skills will be transferable.

<br>

<title-3>* Lower setup and ownership costs:</title-3>

<br>

When looking for closed-source software solutions, most packages are either commercial freemium plans or monthly subscription services. 

The former can be very frustrating, as the most important features are locked behind paywalls, meaning you will pay more in the long run. 

Open-source software is usually free, meaning there are no upfront download or installation costs, and all features are available. Although some open source packages charge a subscription fee, they are usually more affordable and offer better value for money.

<br>

<title-3>* Open source brings financial advantages:</title-3>

<br>

Open-source can reduce costs and minimize maintenance. Of course, the most significant cost benefit comes from getting a complete, tested software package at no charge. Enhancements and bug fixes also come to the software from external sources, which keeps maintenance costs low. 

Development occurs outside your organization, resulting in new features with little effort. 

Using open-source makes financial sense. Some prices are associated with available sources, such as installation time, learning time, and ongoing maintenance and configuration, but closed source software incurs the exact costs.

<br>

<title-3>* Reliability and security:</title-3>

<br>

Although the public nature of open source software may make many entrepreneurs and startups fear the worst, it is one of the most reliable and secure options. 

Thousands of developers view, test, and modify the source code. In turn, users will quickly identify any bugs or vulnerabilities. Although hackers can also access the source code, any attempt they make will soon be thwarted by the network of workers.

Thanks to the high-security measures provided by the developer network, startups can also enjoy less downtime, as the need to check for viruses or deal with data loss and other related problems will be reduced.

<br>

<title-3>* Sustainability and support:</title-3>

<br>

Open-source software is constantly evolving, as the developer network continuously analyzes the source code and frameworks to raise the bar of possibilities. 

Therefore, any tool used under this software solution and agreement must offer sustainability. Therefore, there is no need to keep changing programs or Apps, as the community continuously listens to the needs of the startups to ensure that the applications offer everything they need.

<br>

<title-3>* Strong networking community:</title-3>

<br>

Behind every open-source project is a community that develops, maintains, and promotes it. 

You might also get discounts, free admissions to events, and a well-developed infrastructure to run your projects. Working on open source projects saves you money, but it also inspires you to use all the most powerful tools available to you in your projects.

<br>

<title-3>* Software quality:</title-3>

<br>

Open-source is usually of higher quality. Software created by a team of developers may be of lower quality than software developed by thousands of developers worldwide with expertise in different technologies, industries, and projects. And bugs in open-source software are identified quickly since multiple developers constantly review the code. 

Even code written by a single developer is usually of higher quality if it is open-source.


Any entrepreneur who wants to unleash the full idea potential must choose the right software solutions. 

While some applications will use proprietary software, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/enterprise-open-source-software-erp-platforms/">   open-source software </a> will bring many advantages if you develop your app like this. 

It is more affordable, reliable, agile, and customizable. 

If a developer's network supports you, it is a great way to build better infrastructure. In case you do not, it's ok too.
