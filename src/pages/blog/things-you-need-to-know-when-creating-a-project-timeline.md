Project timelines optimize how project managers keep track of who needs to complete certain tasks at specific times. A well-rounded project timeline improves communication between each department or team involved in the project by clearly assigning duties, due dates, and responsibilities. 

Creating a project timeline has traditionally involved utilizing a spreadsheet, which can be too restrictive when it comes to mapping the scope of a complex, time-consuming project. Spreadsheets are also slow to operate since every detail needs to be manually added. 

Using a project timeline tool streamlines how a project is planned and completed. There are many different timeline tools out there, but one of the most <a target="_blank" href="https://userwell.com/pert-chart/"> flexible tools for project timelines is the PERT chart. </a> 

Every project planner should know seven critical things before they begin.

<br>

<title-2>Define the Project’s Milestones</title-2>

<br>

By immediately defining your project’s overarching goals, you can begin the process of dividing the project up into tasks, which will each have time frames and dependencies that will be discussed later in this article. 

An oversimplified project timeline that only defines the project’s completion as the overarching goal will lead to confusion over responsibilities for smaller tasks and chaotic scheduling. Helpful project timelines have numerous vital milestones leading up to their completion. These milestones can be seen as stepping stones to reach the final product.

Key milestones differ from other tasks because they illustrate the progression of a project. They are checkpoints that indicate different phases a project goes through until it reaches completion.

<br>

<title-2>Know Your Time Frames</title-2>

<br>

Knowing a project’s time frame helps project managers identify key dates and times and, in turn, communicate deadlines to a project’s team. 

Assigning due dates to crucial milestones will help keep a project on track. However, knowing what time frames your project is operating in is just one facet of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-create-a-project-timeline">  project timeline creation </a>. The other, estimating time per task, will be explained later on.

<br>

<title-2>Dependencies</title-2>

<br>

Most projects have tasks that can’t be completed until another is. To keep track of the workflow, project timelines are created with <a target="_blank" href="https://ied.eu/blog/what-are-dependencies-in-project-management/">   dependencies </a>. A dependency defines the relationship between tasks. It tells different teams responsible for a project who or what they will depend on to complete their tasks. Dependencies are typically ordered, meaning you can’t complete step three without first completing steps one and two. 

A good project planner understands that dependencies are complex and not always linear. Projects tend to have numerous areas of overlap. For example, Team A and Team B might need a task completed by Team C before they can begin their duties, and so on. Having clearly defined dependencies allows team members to know who is responsible for which task and when.

A timeline chart will show each stakeholder in the project where they will overlap with another stakeholder. If Team A and Team B can simultaneously work on a task, the timeline tools will show them.

In this way, timeline tools reduce the number of emails that need to be sent out and tracked, making communication simple and easy.

<br>

<title-2>Emphasize Task Priority</title-2>

<br>

Even if project tasks are ordered a certain way, some tasks will have greater priority than others. Emphasizing which tasks have high priority allows team members to understand how much attention to detail a task requires.

That’s not to say tasks with a lower priority aren’t crucial for the project overall. Lower priority tasks may simply require fewer resources and manpower or, as discussed in the next section, time. 

<br>

<title-2>Estimate Time Needed for Each Task</title-2>

<br>

Estimating how much time a task needs can be complex. An overly optimistic time estimate could create significant delays for key milestones, while a too loose of a time estimate can cause the entire project to be inefficient. 

To get started with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/five-keys-accurate-project-estimating-6927">   timeline estimates</a>, it’s best to first take note of which tasks are more time-consuming and which tasks can be easily and quickly completed. For project planners having difficulty estimating a time frame on unfamiliar tasks, it’s best to reach out to the department or team responsible.

<br>

<title-2>Save Room for Minor Delays</title-2>

<br>

When it comes to accurately estimating time frames, a project planner must remember that not everything will go according to plan. Using a PERT chart, which quickly and easily adjusts time frames in case of delays, will make changing task time frames easier in case of delays.

It’s also important to remember that tasks will not be seamlessly handed off between each team or department involved. Accounting for the amount of time it might take for one team to hand off responsibility to the next will create more accurate time frames and keep your project on track.

<br>

<title-2>Make Changes When Necessary</title-2>

<br>

Because it’s so easy to use project timeline tools, it’s also easy to make adjustments when necessary. PERT charts, for example, are adaptable and make it easier to tackle any roadblocks that may come up. 

As a project gets underway, project planners may discover that certain tasks need to be reorganized, added, or deleted. Timeline tools allow a project planner to make necessary changes without disrupting or delaying the project’s progress.

<br>

<title-3>Conclusion</title-3>

<br>

Mapping out a project timeline doesn’t have to be challenging or time-consuming. Project timeline tools, like PERT charts, will help you effectively and accurately map out a project while keeping every team member involved and up-to-date on their responsibilities and deadlines.
