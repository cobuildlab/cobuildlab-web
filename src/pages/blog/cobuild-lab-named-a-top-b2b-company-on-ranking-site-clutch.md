<a target="_blank" href="https://clutch.co/"> Clutch</a> is a B2B ratings and reviews platform based in Washington, DC. They evaluate technology service and solutions companies based on the quality of work, thought leadership, and client reviews. A rapidly expanding startup, Clutch has become the go-to resource in the agency space. Their review process is reliable and transparent, and we’re grateful to those of our clients who have taken the time to provide feedback. <br> </br>

Clutch is always looking for an honest opinion from the client, that is why during the review process they make a creative positioning of questions to provide the user with a complete overview of the company's services and the client's experience. After receiving a service, the client begins his review with a summary of the project and a description of the challenge that was presented; then he answers open questions about the solution and the results obtained from working with that company. <br> </br>

Reviews are very important since the honest opinion of those clients acts as feedback for the company to improve its services as well as inviting potential clients to learn more about the company's workflow.  As Winston Churchill once said *"Criticism may not be agreeable, but it is necessary"*, well-managed reviews are an effective tool for professional development. Thanks to our clients’ participation and honest feedback on our work we can improve our communication and customer relations to provide a better service. <br> </br>

We feel extremely proud of the efforts of our teams and in the name of everyone in Cobuild Lab, we would like to thank all the people that have supported us and contributed to the growth of our company. We are committed and we want to keep on improving so we invite you to surf <a target="_blank" href="https://clutch.co/profile/cobuild-lab"> our profile</a>, write us a line or leave a review. And once again, thank you so much for reading! <br> </br>
