**How to become a Unicorn Startup**


This could be one of the most important things. Why? Because it is not enough to know what is a unicorn startup. The ideal would be to become in one.

* You look for investors how if your life depends on it. It is not necessary that all money invested comes from you. Actually, it is better when you can join more and more people through time.
* Companies’ purchases. Some startups become in a unicorn when others big companies invest in theirs. Even it could happen that big companies buy it. And that does mean more money and investment, that is to say, more value. 
* Use new and better technologies through time. This is one of the principal qualities of startups. You need to learn and take advantage of every new technology in your company. In that way, you can control massive economies, and of course, to produce more money.
* The capital gets it so higher you can. This is a form of how the company can increase its value.

Time passes, and startups are most common. Some of that it is due to its ease for getting simpler some processes that are not using new technologies. All of these without mentioning time, that is used in an efficient and faster way, mass sells, communication with customers, and innovation.
