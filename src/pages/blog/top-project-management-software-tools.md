<title-2>What is Project Management Software?</title-2>

<br>

Project management software is a type of software used in the planning and execution of projects to make a team more productive and a project more effective. It can also be used for scheduling, resource allocation, and project change management.  It allows cost control, budget management, quality management, documentation, and can also be used as an administration system. Project management software is also used for collaboration and communication between project stakeholders.

<title-2>Some features that a project management software should have</title-2>

<br>

**Planning:**  In the planning stage, the scope of the project is defined, the necessary resources, the schedule, the execution procedure, the communication strategy, the necessary steps for testing and maintenance, etc. This is one of the most important phases since it is where everything is born. 

**Task management:**  In this function, there must be the ability to create and assign tasks, deadlines, and status reports. This is so that the entire development team is in the same phase and that each person knows what they have to do.

**Time management:   Software must have the ability to track time for all tasks and maintain records for third-party consultants.

**Calendar and contact sharing:** Project timelines include scheduled meetings, activity dates, and contacts that should automatically update across all PM and stakeholder calendars.

**Bug and error management:** Project management software facilitates bug and error reporting, viewing, notifying, and updating for stakeholders.
