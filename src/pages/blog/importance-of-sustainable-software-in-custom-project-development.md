A software development customized to the requirements and needs of your company is one of the best ideas to carry out for 2021. Sustainable development allows teams to deliver value faster, with higher quality, predictability, and greater ability to respond to change. Today we will be showing you the best practices and methodologies we have in <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/">  Cobuild Lab</a> to develop your custom software in a sustainable way and with many benefits for both parties. 

<br>

<title-2>What do we call sustainable software development?</title-2>

<br>

Sustainable software is a value proposition that we manage at Cobuild Lab. 

It's software development with small iterations, tests, and gradual integration into a company's system. 

In this way, we achieve a better match between the solution you expect and the one we develop. 

It's a slightly different concept than what other software development companies traditionally offer, usually preferring large and long-term projects. 

In our lab, we prefer to develop small pieces of software in an agile way, and with a high focus on communication with you, as our client, and with your team at the time of implementation. 

Our goal is to implement each of these software snacks as quickly as possible, to verify if it's consistent with your company's processes, and reduce, in that way, features adjustment at the end of each stage.

It's eating the cake piece by piece. 

We have the team and technology capabilities to develop large and ambitious software solutions, but we'll segment them in small stages to have the least possible waste, and making sure that the solution we're developing is exactly what you need and want. We call this concept "zero waste", and later you'll see more about it. 

Of course, we also work with agile methodologies and frameworks that facilitate the software development process over time.

<br>

<title-2>Highlights of sustainable software development</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>1. Zero waste</title-3>

<br>

Waste in software development occurs when after the completion of the project phases, you discover during testing or integration that some developed features do not exactly meet your requirements, were not what you expected, for whatever reason, and you have to constantly go back to make corrections and rewrite lines of code, sometimes from early stages. 

This is not a bad quality per se. In software development, these comings and goings are admitted, but we try to make them as rare as possible. This way we save time, work, and we can satisfy your demands 100%. We achieve this with a granular testing and integration process, and very closely followed. This way we make sure that it is functional, that it meets your demands, and we avoid that waste. 

If you want to know more about our process, you can contact us at this link.

What you should know by now is that the zero waste quality of our sustainable software is related to the way we integrate the software into your processes. 

Instead of making large deliveries, and offering you projects with fast, single, long-term integration, we offer you a granular way, in which you test and integrate each feature quickly and gradually. In this way:

* We eliminate software waste. 
* We increase your customer satisfaction
* A real improvement of the processes takes place
* Your customers or employees will be happy and satisfied
* You save time and money
* Rework is reduced. 

As a customer, what did you think about this quality of zero waste in software development? Have you heard of it before? If you liked it, let's get started today!

<br>

<title-3>2. Software snacks</title-3>

<br>

Software snacks are a metaphor for the small features we develop in our process, to test and integrate as quickly as possible. The main goal is: 

Segment the investment in a way that is comfortable and feasible for you. 
Continue with your company's processes, and adapt simple, smooth, and as fast as possible the new tool. 

Increase your participation as a customer in the development phases. Even if you have a product owner or a project manager, you are the one who tests and can measure in each weekly delivery the temperature of the project and decide if you are 100% satisfied. 

It allows us to develop stable, strong, and lasting relationships as supplier-customer. 

Increase your confidence in our service. 

Guarantee your satisfaction with the final result. 

Make your team's transition to the new toolless challenge. 

Avoid implementation problems or incompatibility with your systems and processes. 

<br>

<title-3>3. Progressive integration and implementation</title-3>

<br>

When we talk about the progressive implementation of the software we refer to development, testing, integration, re-testing, correction (if necessary), and immediate use. 

The good thing about this way of working is that it guarantees that the developed solution is 100% compatible with the process you want to automate or complement. 

It also assures us that the team members will know how to use the tool perfectly, and will do so in the shortest possible time. 

It allows operations to continue during the system upgrade (a valuable factor, especially in logistics and supply chain, which literally cannot be stopped). 

And of course, it reduces the software waste we mentioned two points ago. 

We make this feature possible in our agile software developments (using frameworks that make it possible) such as SCRUM, for example. 

<br>

<title-2>Some benefits of sustainable development</title-2>

<br>

* We reduce the waste. Thanks to the monthly and weekly advances, we can progressively test the development and discard what doesn't work or isn't relevant to the project.

* Sustainable software is agile too which means that you'll enjoy all benefits of this kind of framework.

* Better coordination with you as the customer. Because when the development team finishes a micro-phase, you can test it, and even we'll integrate the small piece of software, so you have the opportunity to share your point of view, and improve or correct what you want (if it's necessary). For any reason is given another step until the previous one is fully corrected.

* Also, a great advantage is that your company doesn't stop working. Your productivity continues because we integrate small. This is one of the reasons why functions and tools are progressively integrated into the software you are using. As we all know, stopping activities is not profitable for any company.

* It adapts to the pocket of investors and customers, because as we have already said, we do it in an agile way, dividing the project into mini and micro phases for implementation, test, and integration, but for investment too. It's also divided into several phases.

* Reduced time to market relative to cascading processes due to reduced overhead and increased efficiency. 

* Improved customer satisfaction results in higher customer retention and more positive referrals.

* Team members enjoy development work, and they like to see their work used and valued.

* Product managers and product owners are responsible for making you happy by ensuring that development work is aligned with your needs. This kind of development makes this alignment easier by providing frequent opportunities to reprioritize work to ensure maximum value delivery.
