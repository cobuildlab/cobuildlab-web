Miami, FL. Jan 10, 2022

Managing information is a titanic task for companies today and it’s the biggest business in the world right now. Facebook and Google confirmed it. 

In the real world, companies don't know a lot about how to take advantage of the information they get. For example, customers data, providers, performance statistics, and so on.

Thanks to big data this has changed. 

Big data environments process, manage and analyze many different types of data, letting you reap all of its benefits.  

The wealth of data available to organizations includes customer databases and emails, Internet click logs, log files, images, social media posts, sensor data, medical information, and much more. 

Suppose you get to know your customers better and know what they like and dislike. What do you do to use this information in favor? Keep reading and discover all of the **big data benefits**.

<br>

<title-2>Let’s begin with the meaning of big data</title-2>

<br>

Big Data is the massive analysis of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Why-to-Use-Automatic-Identification-and-Data-Capture-in-Warehouses-and-Distribution-Centers-this-2020/"> data </a>. It comprises a set of data or combinations of data sets whose size (volume), complexity (variability), and speed of growth (velocity) make it difficult to capture, manage, process or analyze using conventional technologies and tools, such as relational databases and conventional statistics or visualization packages.

The goal is to develop a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services"> robust software tool </a> that can execute all these actions, so that you can take advantage of it commercially, in strategic decision-making, and in other strategies of interest to your company. 

This "big data" is divided into two ways, structured and unstructured data. 

Of course, depending on the company, you will have one more than the other; but there will always be both. 

<br>

<title-2>How big data has been used for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/robots-AI-and-machine-learning-for-your-SMB/"> small businesses </a> (SMEs)?</title-2>

<br>

Small businesses have utilized big data in many ways to take full advantage of it. Let’s go over them.

<br>

<title-3>* Use your CRM intelligently:</title-3>

<br>

Companies use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/custom-customer-management-system"> CRM </a> to manage their customer information. This tool is of utmost importance during the management of information as it has allowed companies to understand their customers, get closer to them, and know what they are looking for. 

<br>

<title-3>* Companies have been able to integrate their data:</title-3>

<br>

By implementing an integration solution, companies have been able to keep their contact database consistent and up-to-date across applications to ensure that their customer data is well integrated across their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Custom-software-Artificial-intelligence-IoT/"> application stack </a>. You can synchronize contacts in real-time and streamline contact management.

<br>

<title-3>* Big data allows to generate reports:</title-3>

<br>

Thanks to big data, companies can generate reports of their information management and reach a conclusion faster, facilitate market analysis, and assist in making decisions. 

In short, companies have been able to be more serious and efficient in recent years thanks to big data.

<br>

<title-3>* Companies can act on their data:</title-3>

<br>

As a small business, you can use your data to personalize your emails, segment your email lists, use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/SEO-trends-for-2022/"> SEO </a> research to influence your content strategy, use dynamic or smart content on your website based on device, geography, lead status, or other properties to personalize content, send more relevant content to a lead based on their preferences, and trigger internal workflows based on customer actions to deliver the best service.

You can also create A/B tests for emails and automatically send the best content, trigger your company or team strategies to match what is working best, deliver the most relevant advertising and channel your spend to the highest performing channels and campaigns, and of course, automatically organize contacts into the most relevant groups and lists in your CRM.

<br>

<title-2>5 benefits of big data for businesses</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Cuts costs:</title-3>

<br>

Big data can have a significant impact on reducing costs in your organization by identifying costly processes and redundant workflows. With the latest data, you can find areas of your business to scale up or down. This can have long-term financial benefits. 

It also allows you to make investments in other areas that are of more importance such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/new-product-development-for-small-business/"> new product development </a> and research.

<br>

<title-3>* Improve customer service:</title-3>

<br>

Personalized customer service derived from big data analytics will help you engage with customers at a deeper level and provide personalized service that drives sales. 

Big data drives better customer service. With real-time information about your customer base, you can discover how consumers think and behave, and make changes to your business as a result.

<br>

<title-3>* Increase revenue:</title-3>

<br>

Big data increases revenue in some ways. Analytics gives you detailed information about the customer lifecycle and can identify new ways to drive sales. 

Good data can give you the confidence you need to launch a new product or diversify your business, which could prove lucrative. These projections enable companies to grow and even take an interest in new markets.

<br>

<title-3>* Improve team management:</title-3>

<br>

Big data also makes it easier to manage your small business team - you can identify the employees who bring you the most value, those who need additional resources or training. That's because analytics systems generate insights that help you <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/workflows-in-your-business/"> increase productivity </a> and keep employees happy. 

You facilitate work across teams and improve workload sharing.

<br>

<title-3>* Make sense of social media:</title-3>

<br>

Big data can be used to identify your company's social media mentions, including positive experiences and complaints, and analyze unstructured data to find valuable information you can use to make smarter business decisions in the future. 

Leverage all social media platforms that make sense for your business - Twitter, Instagram, <a target="_blank" href="www.facebook.com"> Facebook </a>, Snapchat, etc.

<title-2>What do you need to develop a big data software solution for your SME?</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>1. Establish clear business KPIs and estimate ROI</title-3>

<br>

First of all, it is critical to establish clear KPI’s and calculate ROI. If you need to validate the feasibility and profitability of your big data analytics system, you can undertake a business strategy discovery phase, and based on rigorous calculations for different scenarios, either go for integrating third-party solutions or building your own big data analytics system. 

The product discovery phase will provide you with all the deliverables needed to efficiently kick off the implementation phase while mitigating risks and optimizing costs. 

<br>

<title-3>2. Ensure effective big data engineering</title-3>

<br>

Each of the engineering processes must be carried out correctly to ensure that it does not have errors in the future, so you need to focus on: 


* Choosing the right data sources;
* An orchestrated ecosystem of platforms that collect siloed data from hundreds of sources
* Cleaning, aggregating, and preprocessing the data to make it fit for a specific business case;
* In some cases, applying Data Science or Machine Learning models;
* Visualizing the insights. 

Before applying any algorithms or visualizing the data, it must be properly structured and cleaned. Only then will you be able to convert that data into information.

Before big data platforms and tools were developed, many organizations could only use a small fraction of their data in operational and analytical applications. The rest was often left aside as so-called dark data, which is processed and stored but not used. 

Big data creates greater opportunities for machine learning, predictive analytics, data mining, stream analytics, text mining, and other data science and advanced analytics disciplines. 

Through these disciplines, big data analytics applications help companies better understand customers, identify operational problems, detect fraudulent transactions, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Supply-chain-synchronization/"> manage supply chains </a>, among other uses. So don't procrastinate and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services"> start developing a tool </a> to advantage **big data benefits** at your SME.
