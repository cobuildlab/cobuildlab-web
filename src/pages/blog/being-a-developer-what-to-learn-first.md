<title-2>To be or not to be a developer is a dilemma</title-2>

There is no dilemma. If you are passionate about technology, creative, and love to devise practical solutions, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   software development</a> is your ideal career. 

Being a developer is pretty cool. It's a career path that allows you to <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Remote-work-team-productivity-how-to-manage-your-processes/">   work remotely</a> and, very importantly, have good financial benefits. We are not here to talk about late nights or coding or testing but about what you need to stand out in this professional area.

So, let's hit it! Here are some steps to consider if you decide to <b>be a developer.</b>

Although many may think that the first thing is to learn about programming languages because, come on, that's the essence of the job, right? But no, this is not the first step to follow. 

Now, let's list the steps:

<b><title-4>1. Pick a niche</title-4></b>

Software and digital platform development are not just about code. It also deals with <a target="_blank" href="[aqui va el link](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/user-experience/)">   user experience</a>, databases, applications, and more. Therefore, choosing the area where you would like to work is necessary. 

This does not mean you can't do it in all of them. There is a term for this, and we will see it later, but first, let's look at some areas in which you can specialize.

<b>- Frontend:</b> Builds the user interface, aesthetics, and layoutsâ€”basically, everything the user sees and interacts with when using the product.

<b>- Backend:</b> Maps the corresponding servers and databases by devising a functional logic between them. It is what the user does not see but rather what allows information to flow through the system. 

<b>- Full-stack:</b> Performs in both frontend and backend.

<b>- Mobile:</b> Optimize applications and platforms to work on mobile devices. It possesses a piece of extensive knowledge in mobile operating systems such as iOS and Android. 

<b>- Game:</b> Design and build the gaming experience on digital platforms. 

<b>- Application:</b> Create applications for pc, browsers, mobile devices, and more.

Once you have decided what area you want to work in, you can start looking for the tools and knowledge that directly address the demands of that area. <br></br>

<b><title-4>2. Coding</title-4></b>

The ideal would be to obtain a computer science degree, attend programming courses, or attend coding boot camps, which are short but effective learning. 

In the same way, if you are getting into programming and want to learn more, we show you the programming languages you should pay special attention to start being a developer.

Here are five programming languages that you should take a look at if you want to become a developer:

<b>- Python</b> has some compelling features: it is open source, has a simple syntax, and is easy to understand, thus saving time and resources.

<b>- Java</b> is a general-purpose, object-oriented language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It allows software creation for mobile devices, sales terminals, IoT, web pages, and more. 

<b>- C#</b>, Created by Microsoft. It also has versatile uses such as IoT, video game development, and web or mobile applications.

<b>- C++</b> is characterized by being extremely fast and stable. In addition, it provides STL (Standard Template Library), i.e., a set of ready-to-use resources for different data structures, arithmetic operations, and algorithms.

<b>- Javascript</b> is one of the most widely used programming languages for creating dynamic web pages. An active page incorporates effects, such as text that appears and disappears, animations, actions that are activated when buttons are pressed, and more.

Each programming language has its pros and cons, and they are designed to fulfill specific purposes according to the area of work you want to perform as a developer. <br></br>

<b><title-4>3. Be part of the community</title-4></b>

One of the best ways to learn is to meet with experts or even novices who spend their time researching and sharing programming information. 

Software development is a <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/careers/">   career</a> that requires a lot of study and dedication because of how extensive it can be and the different areas it covers. 

Internet forums, social networks, and other communities are excellent options for getting involved and connecting with people with the same vocation and even using these tools as catapults for job networking.

What do you say? Would you like to use your creative power to take root in technology and build <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/innovation-to-your-business/">   innovative solutions</a> for digital devices?

If the answer is yes, you are about to enter an extraordinary world where all the hard work you put into learning (which will be a lot) will be duly rewarded with merit, self-confidence, and, of course, profit.
