Many industry leaders are exploring <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Remote-work-team-productivity-how-to-manage-your-processes/">   remote work </a> after the pandemic and what it will look like. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work/2021">   Buffer's survey </a> on remote jobs in 2021, most remote workers (97.6%) would like to work at least some of the time remotely for the rest of their careers.

Over time this has been changing and evolving; here's a little more about what it's all about and why it's leading the technology world.

With the rise of the digital age and the popularity of the #workfromwherever and #digitalnomad trends, telecommuting has seen a massive spread in recent years. However, working from home is a concept that has been introduced previously. Long before the advent of the Internet, people were working from home.

Then came the digital age, and another paradigm shift occurred. When the Internet was invented in the early 1980s, workers had already used UNIX and DOS for years. Creating a system that linked existing networks opened up a new world of connectivity and alternative ways of working with it.

According to a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-04-03-gartner-cfo-surey-reveals-74-percent-of-organizations-to-shift-some-employees-to-remote-work-permanently2">   Gartner survey </a>, 74% of businesses plan to shift their employees to remote positions as part of their post-COVID plans. Telecommuting has seen a boom of 115% in the last decade and will continue to rise as we adjust to the new reality of a post-pandemic world. It's the future of remote work.

One case study even indicated that the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Remote-work-team-productivity-how-to-manage-your-processes/">   increased productivity </a> of remote workers was equivalent to another full day's work.

Statistics show that most people who switch to remote work never look back. <a target="_blank" href="https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work/2018">   90% of remote workers </a> intend to continue working remotely for the rest of their careers. They are also more than happy to <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/from-desk-to-dawn-how-the-remote-work-lifestyle-affect-productivity/">   recommend this lifestyle </a> to others, with <a target="_blank" href="https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work/2018">   94% of remote workers </a> encouraging others to do the same.

The bottom line is that allowing teams to work remotely will enable companies to increase their employee retention rates. They no longer have to worry as much about the hassle, expense, and disruption caused when team members leave for greener pastures.

The advantages far outweigh the disadvantages, so it's time to prepare for the future of work and the extent to which remote work will be a part of it.

<title-2>Some reasons why remote work is leading the world's technology industry</title-2>

<br>

* **Pandemic Effect:** The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted labor markets globally in 2020 and 2021. Millions lost jobs, and others rapidly adjusted to working from home as offices closed. 2021 was the year the world stayed remote. 

The most apparent impact of COVID-19 on the labor force is the increased number of employees working remotely. Many companies realized the benefits of remote work and are adopting hybrid models for the long haul. Covid has accelerated the rise of remote work. Before Covid, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/switching-to-remote-work-is-the-new-black/">   remote work </a> was nice to have. Now, it’s a must-have for <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/it-support/">   IT </a> jobs.

* **Remote work improves work-life balance:** One of the most significant advantages of telecommuting is that employees achieve a better work-life balance. This means they can manage their flexible work schedules to create a balance in their personal and professional lives. People can work as needed from their home office, a coffee shop, or a co-working space. 

Having a healthy work-life balance brings long-term benefits to both employees and organizations. Not only are telecommuters happier, but they are also more motivated to produce high-quality work.

* **Working remotely increases employee productivity:** Most managers and team leaders need to realize how annoying the traditional office space can be. It's impossible to stay focused with interruptions like noisy co-workers and water cooler breaks. Instead, people can spend time in their controlled environment, which is conducive to deep thinking. 

Employees who create flexible schedules will also be encouraged to start working during their most productive hours. Some people are early risers, while others tend to be night owls. In either case, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/exercises-to-promote-the-mental-health-of-your-remote-developers-team/">   remote teams </a> can boost their productivity by completing projects according to their preferences. 

* **Remote work lowers costs:** Entrepreneurs can save money on traditional office space and resources with fewer people. This includes rent, electricity, equipment, furniture, and services such as coffee and snacks. Many remote workers use their computers and laptops at home, so companies can save money on upgrading hardware.

Working in open offices increases the likelihood of contracting illnesses; teams working at home tend to get sick less often. Therefore, premiums can go down over time by paying for employee health insurance.

* **Remote work gives access to a broader pool of talents:** In a world where unemployment constantly changes, finding the talent you need to build your brand is critical. Organizations with full-time, in-house workers only have access to a limited pool of talent. They can only hire people within driving distance of the building. Remote companies, on the other hand, can <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/remote-worker-profile/">   recruit incredible people </a> with talents they never otherwise would have gotten. This means businesses can bring in new skill sets and outperform their competitors.

* **Remote working improves the use of technology:** Remote work is possible today because of the wide range of technology and tools available. With increased Wi-Fi access, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/how-to-boost-your-business-with-cloud-based-technology/">   cloud storage </a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/app-development/">   smartphone applications </a>, staying connected with your teams is easier than ever. In the past, managers would have to walk to the employee’s desks and see whether they are using their time well. However, with <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/custom-project-management-system/">   project management software </a> and other programs, team leaders can monitor productivity without looking over someone’s shoulder.

* **Working remotely for improved employee retention:** Giving employees a chance to work from anywhere greatly incentivizes job applicants and new hires. Remote jobs are a benefit that often motivates individuals to stay in their current positions, boosting employee retention rates. And when employee retention rates are improved, this creates a chain reaction of other benefits. Organizations can enjoy reduced onboarding costs, acquisition and training time, and productivity. 


Technology sector employees find that telecommuting helps boost creativity and productivity. Working in your own space makes a big difference in an industry that relies on individual thinking and innovation. Times are changing, and **remote IT works** are radically changing the tech industry. Get moving and boost your business with this modality.
