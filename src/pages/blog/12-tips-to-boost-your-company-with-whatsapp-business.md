Here we let you some ideas or strategies that you can apply to maximize the reaching of your company, business or startup with WhatsApp Business in a casual and simple way.

1.  **Download**

The first step is to download the app in Google Play (It is not available to iOS). Then you can use the same number that you have had but you will no longer be “Manuel Gómez”; you will have a company profile, so we recommend you to put its name. There you can provide a description of your company, address, e-mail, web page and other dates that do you think is convenient.

2.  **Contact list**

Use your contact list as a first phone database to send and share information about your company with your friends and family. After, you can ask the telephone number of your clients and consult them that if they want to receive information about your product or service.

3.  **Humanize**

Talk and answer the questions that customers do as a common person, real, not as a machine or a group. They have to feel that they are talking to a person. Treat them with familiarity, but without losing the respect.

4.  **Control and careful**

You have to be so careful to not become a spam. Do not abuse sending messages at any time or day. We recommend you that send two or three messages to week and take advantage of the actualization of states to post your information; in this way, you will not invade the chat tray of your clients.

5.  **Schedule**

Just like your company has a schedule to work and to attend to the clients, in WhatsApp Business you can establish a schedule to respond to the doubts of your clients and to send messages. Do not do this outside of office hours because can bother them. In addition, this accustoms them to fact that there is a schedule for attention; even when you are working 24 hours a day.
