Measuring the progress of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">software development teams </a> can be a crucial step in your new software development.

At Cobuild Lab, we use software metrics to track the performance of the app and the software team. That helps us to improve our results, so we recommend it to everyone who wants to start a new project.

Understanding some software metrics will help you better manage the programming process of your new tool.

Below in this article, we will introduce you to some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/enterprise-software-development-vs-custom-software-development/">   software development </a> metrics and how you can use them in favor, even when your software team is outsourced. So, size the **performance of your software product** and team and make the difference!

<br>

<title-2>1. Critical metrics to measure the performance of a software tool</title-2>

<br>

A software metric is a characteristic measurable or countable of software. They are used for several things, such as software performance evaluation, planning, and during the app lifecycle.

Observing different numbers and trends as the product development unfolds allows you to use software metrics to improve the software team's performance, plan upcoming work tasks, and follow the process more.

You can also use software metrics combined with management functions to simplify your projects by designing more efficient systems, developing software maintenance plans, and keeping production teams informed about problems that need to be fixed.

Many metrics are intertwined throughout the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/software-testing-in-software-development/">   software development process </a>. We follow the four primary management metrics in a software project: planning, organizing, controlling, and improving.

We provide specific software tools, but that does not imply common software process control. On the contrary, we always measure and improve our software process to improve service.

<title-2>1. Key aspects to know if a software solution achieved its best version</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>1. Agile Process Metrics</title-3>

<br>

* **Lead Time:** The lead time metric measures the time lapse between task creation and job completion. It gives you a broader perspective on how long it takes to complete the feature requested by a customer.

It can help you identify potential issues between task creation and the time a developer starts working on it to understand if you are following an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/sustainable-software-project-with-agile-methodologies/">   agile process </a>. It can locate and unblock those issues that can cause friction and frustration for end-users. 

* **Cycle Time:** The cycle time metric measures the time to initiate and complete a task. It is essential for assessing the development speed of an organization. 

It comprises several agile process metrics that correspond to a stage of the software development process: coding, collection, review, and deployment.

* **Open/Close Rates:** The number of production problems reported and resolved in a given period is the open/close rate. The overall trend is more important than the precise data.
 
* **Team Velocity:** Team velocity is the number of software units a team completes in an iteration or sprint. 

It is a non-comparable internal metric for software development teams and should only be used when planning an iteration. There is no point in comparing team velocities because the metric depends on subjective judgments.

<br>

<title-3>1. Production Metrics</title-3>

<br>

* **Active Days:** The number of busy days a software developer spends contributing code to a software development project measures how much time they spend working on it. It does not include responsibilities such as planning and management. This software statistic is used to calculate the hidden costs of outages.

* **Work Log:** It brings valuable data based on software metrics, such as code commits, merges commits, open/closed/merged PRs, and PR comments. You cannotice when something may be out of place when teams are delaying release or what release may be at risk. 

At the same time, it helps you understand when to experiment with processes or find a healthier distribution of work.

* **Code churn:** The number of lines of code modified, added, or deleted in a given period is called code churn. 

When code churn increases, it may indicate that the software development project requires attention.

* **Impact:** This software development metric speaks to the complexity of the output of the product. More precisely, it measures the extent of code changes that occur in a more complex way than the LoC metric. 

The impact helps find an approximate value of engineers' cognitive load when implementing changes.

* **Mean Time to Recover (MTTR):** Another technical incident metric refers to the average time it takes to recover from a product or system failure. Use it to calculate the time spent during an outage – from the moment it fails to when it becomes operational. Also, it’s usually relevant in assessing the stability of a team. 

<br>

<title-3>1. Security or Test Metrics </title-3>

<br>

* **Code Coverage:** This metric determines the percentage of lines of code successfully validated under a test procedure. It, in turn, helps determine how well the software is verified and if the code is readable and maintainable. Pair it with other metrics to fully understand how likely the software is to contain errors or undetected bugs.

* **Commit Risk:** Risk metrics measure the likelihood that a particular commit will cause problems. Eliminating any risk means more quality, stable code for end-users. You can think of it as a pattern-matching engine.

The ability to track the right metrics can be the difference between a highly productive team and one struggling. And measuring **application performance** is the only way to know if you will be successful.

So don't wait any longer and start measuring these metrics in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   your software development projects </a>, or ask your specific solution provider <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/">   (such as Cobuild Lab) </a>. Your bank account will love it,and consequently, so will you.
