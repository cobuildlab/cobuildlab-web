There are areas of business operations that are introducing and applying Artificial Intelligence <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/How-artificial-intelligence-impacts-your-business-supply-chain/">  (AI)</a></b> as a great alternative to improve overall processes, and procurement is not being left behind.

<br>

Presently, AI is one of the most trending methods,  given that it can provide many solutions and tackle several challenges within the supply chain and logistics management processes.

<br>

<b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Use-and-benefits-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-supply-chain/">  Artificial Intelligence</a></b> can even mean “the solution to problems” or even the future potential when it has to do with business procedures. “Right now, Artificial Intelligence is fundamentally changing a wide array of aspects right at the heart of the logistics sector, and in our very near future and the years to come it will amount to nothing short of a revolution that’ll alter the way we work and understand every single logistic process.” - <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/">  Cobuild Lab</a></b>
<br>

Procurement’s efficacy comes from regaining control of data and how it is managed, so teams that use AI can delegate day-to-day tasks—such as checking invoices against contracts, recordkeeping, and transcription—to a digital assistant. - <b><a target="_blank" href="https://procurementleaders.com/content/blog/guest/artificial-intelligence-time-for-procurement-to-reap-the-rewards-of-automation-682269#.WxBb3dMvzjE">  Former CPO Jean-Phillipe Collin</a></b>

<title-2><b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Artificial-Intelligence-What-is-it/">  What's Artificial Intelligence?</a></b></title-2>

<br>

Artificial Intelligence means the process of simulating the intelligence of a human using machines and artefacts that could mimic their actions.

<br>

<title-2>What’s AI in procurement management?</title-2>

<br>

AI can help procurement management by solving very complex problems, errors, and risks using smart algorithms, since Artificial Intelligence can be embedded into several software applications that could be able to analyze spending, produce strategies and tactics for a determined process, and much more. The fact that data is vital for procurement operations, is important, because, without the information, the tracking of spending on goods and services wouldn’t be possible, and this would increase the chances of performance errors and risks involving cost and savings. 

<br>

<title-2>What’s the most interesting thing about Artificial Intelligence?</title-2>

<br>

It has the ability to learn and adapt based on any situation and adapt its behavior to achieve anything correctly. Moreover, it is able to act and react even more efficiently than humans could. Artificial Intelligence is not independent, it needs programs it can learn from first to then perform its operations.

<br>

<title-2>How Artificial Intelligence can improve procurement activities?</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>1. Anomalies and patterns detection</title-3>

<br>

AI dominates the search of anomalies in an established information set. Artificial Intelligence has the capability of looking for cost/value disparities, and a great amount of discrepancies and patterns that will recognize errors or mistakes of a company. It can evaluate, detect, and predict purchasing patterns.

<br>

<title-3>2. Menial procurement tasks will improve</title-3>

<br>

It is believed that Artificial Intelligence appliances will assist in the automation of tasks that don't need very much skills or experience. This technology could make menial tasks actionable in a matter of minutes or seconds instead of hours. Did you know that this technology can understand procurement demands even before humans do, and as correctly and precisely?

<br>

<title-3>3. Automation over procurement duties</title-3>

<br>

Complex tasks can be totally transformed by AI. An organization can have the total control over purchases data, and develop the capability of voice recognition (such as Siri or Alexa) feature that can help very busy or off-set employees to change the approval process; Artificial Intelligence could help with simplifying requisition processes and generate reviews or contracts; all of this basically means making certain processes more comprehensive and simple.

<br>

<title-3>4. More intuitive experience for customers</title-3>

<br>

Not only employees can benefit from AI technology, customers too. With this adoption, companies can deliver a very well and smooth customer experience with intelligent automated assistants providing and intelligent customer support (also known as chatbots) during the process of ordering. This means that users can have any question or concern solved quickly without the participation of a human brain within the process.

<br>

<title-3>5. Strategic provision</title-3>

<br>

Prediction of market prices, identifying and analysis of new potential vendors, and the option of assistance when there’s the necessity of success evaluation with existing suppliers is something that can be provided by Artificial Intelligence technology. 

<br>

<title-3>6. Analytics about spending</title-3>

<br>

These analytics can help companies and organizations to identify opportunities for saving, managing risks, and optimize organization’s buying power. What is so important about accurate spending information? It is the foundation of an effective category and sourcing development strategy. 

<br>

<title-3>7. Risks evaluation</title-3>

<br>

This is the last but not least important way that AI can improve procurement and logistics procedures.

<br>

A great interesting factor of AI in procurement is how it can process risk agents; because Artificial Intelligence owns the very unique capacity to analyze millions of data points in seconds so it can deliver solutions with assessed risks. What does it mean in procurement? “Tracking supplier performance and making recommendations based on reliability, stability and other predictable factors.” - Michael Higgins 

<br>

<title-3>What’s the conclusion?</title-3>

<br>

Artificial Intelligence has uncountable capacities when it has to do with supply chain, logistics and procurement management, but particularly in the procurement field there are amazing strategies that can be applied to minimize errors, risks, problems, costs, loss, and more.

<br>

One of the most important aspects of this technology being applied to the procurement process is the ability to detect risks by providing early data to learn from and then, source recommendations that can be totally reliable.
