All around the world,  forwarding companies are facing a big challenge,  and that is to be able to have correct control of each of the packages they receive and are sent to their destination. 

This industry has grown vertiginously, and they have had to adapt new solutions and tools to be able to fulfill the worldwide demand of shipments. This is why companies have adopted **freight forwarding systems** in order to meet the demand, and improve the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/workflows-in-your-business/"> workflows </a> within the company. 

Here is a little more about what this type of software is all about, some of the benefits, and what features it has:  

<br>

<title-2>But first, what is a freight forwarding system?</title-2>

<br>

A freight forwarding software system helps companies manage the receipt, storage, and delivery of cargo in real-time. 

It also creates the necessary documents, such as air waybills and bills of lading needed to move shipments by land, sea, and air. 

Freight forwarding software is the tool forwarders use for their day-to-day operations, including communication with customers, partners, agents, and carriers. 

It also includes functions such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Custom-CRM-business-in-2021/"> CRM </a>, quotations, documents, shipping, accounting, vision, and management control.

<br>

<title-2>Some benefits of a freight forwarding software</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Tends to be more profitable:</title-3>

<br>

Shipping software is more affordable compared to third-party shipping software providers, as it is typically priced as a software solution rather than as a consulting service. 

You only have to pay for it once and you don't have to be patient as it works with your own company's tools. 

Likewise, the total cost of the software depends on your company's shipping needs, allowing your forwarding business to pay only for the services it needs.

<br>

<title-3>* Secure shipping:</title-3>

<br>

Security is one of the most important aspects of these operations because many times without this factor it is impossible to make a shipment. 

The companies invest in this type of system with the purpose of analyzing each of the important aspects such as the shipping company, loading conditions, handling instructions, laws, and regulations, all with the goal of ensuring that the cargo arrives safely and that nobody can get hurt with it.

<br>

<title-3>* Increase the automation and efficiency of your logistics operations:</title-3>

<br>

Moving all shipping information through an electronic system, such as forwarding management software, will also help keep your data safe and secure. 

Manual shipping methods include a large volume of paperwork, such as original quotes, sales orders, bills of lading, warehouse documents, and any other necessary documents. These documents can accumulate quickly and make your company slow to react to any changes along the way.

<br>

<title-3>* Gaining an advantage over your competitors:</title-3>

<br>

A scalable implementation allows your company to save on upfront costs and grow your needs as you begin to become a more successful business. 

You may start using your freight broker software in one way, but discover key areas that your business can improve through built-in analytics features.

<br>
