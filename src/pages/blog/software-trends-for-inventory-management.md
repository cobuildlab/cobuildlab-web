Miami, FL. Sep 23, 2021

Inventory management is a fundamental pillar for any company since it allows it to have the right items at the right time to meet the needs of each of its customers. Always taking into account time and costs, minimizing waste and losses. 

By implementing software and technologies geared towards efficient inventory management, you get many benefits, such as keeping track of the amount of stock to be purchased, maintaining a constant flow of raw materials, generating reports on the manufacturing process and finished products that go from manufacturing to the consumer, through various distribution channels. Here are 10 **software trends for inventory management**  you will see in 2022. 

<br>

<title-2>Inventory management trends in 2022</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Increased use of AGVs and AMRs:</title-3>

<br>

Thanks to the dynamism in which we live, companies must make their deliveries faster. With the use of these technologies such as AGV and AMR, workers can search for products on the shelves, platforms, or pallets of the warehouse. These robots work in conjunction with inventory management software to help with accounting and location within the warehouse. Both types of vehicles reduce the time it takes to move items around the warehouse and free up human staff to perform other tasks and help fulfill orders more quickly. This allows companies to work more efficiently, reducing human error.  

<br>

<title-3>* More integration with the cloud-based solutions:</title-3>

<br>

By increasing the integration of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-using-a-cloud-logistics-solution/"> cloud services</a>, our inventory software can be more efficient and powerful for multiple tasks within the warehouse. Thanks to these tools we can know the location and inventory levels in real-time even from remote warehouses, accurately plot costs based on real-time data, manage relationships with suppliers and other vendors in one place, improve efficiency with data analysis, access systems, and documents anywhere in the world. 

In addition, the cloud, like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/How-can-a-B2B-Software-Company-help-your-business-to-become-a-Saas-Company/"> software-as-a-service </a>, offers other advantages over on-premises applications: lower upfront costs since there is no hardware to buy, faster deployment, constantly updated software, and better security and resiliency than most organizations can create on their own. It is important to highlight that global spending on cloud services grew from $145 billion (2017) to $332 billion (2021), and is expected to reach $397 billion by 2022.

<br>

<title-3>* Predictive picking:</title-3>

<br>

Predictive collections can be a great tool to grow your company's revenue and significantly decrease costs and losses. By integrating this functionality into your inventory management software you will be able to analyze a large amount of data and consumption patterns, to know which product will sell more depending on the time of the year. Of course taking into account certain factors for analysis such as data collection, planned marketing campaigns, weather, and seasonality to predict customer orders with a high degree of accuracy.

<br>

<title-3>* 3PL as a necessity:</title-3>

<br>

Third-party logistics, or 3PL, is where distribution and warehousing or other activity is outsourced to a third party. These services can help companies reach more customers or operate more efficiently without incurring the costs of infrastructure development. The 3PL sector is forecast to grow at a rate of 7.1% through 2027.

<br>

<title-3>* Increased IA integration:</title-3>

<br>

When it comes to warehousing and inventory management, systems with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-logistics-and-supply-chain-process-of-retail-companies/">  artificial intelligence</a> (AI) and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/reduce-your-headcount-with-the-help-of-machine-learning/"> machine learning </a> (ML) capabilities work hand-in-hand with these <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Custom-software-Artificial-intelligence-IoT/"> IoT </a> initiatives.  AI can help warehouses become intelligent. An <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Warehouse-and-Inventory-Management/"> intelligent warehouse</a> is one in which all operations, from procurement to delivery, are managed by AI.

The AI solution helps streamline picking and packing processes. AI solutions can work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. AI robots can be deployed to scan digital labels and provide precise and accurate inventory control. They can also determine the shortest possible routes to place items and even prevent them from colliding with each other. They can help reduce the time and distance to place items in warehouse inventory.

<br>

<title-3>* Omni-channel inventory control:</title-3>

<br>

Align your channels so that a customer can look online to see if a certain item is available at a nearby physical location, make the purchase, and then walk into the store and pick up the item. In reality, omnichannel inventory control requires coordination between the store, distribution center, and e-commerce operations to reconcile physical and online inventory and ensure price parity and discounts or sales.

<br>

<title-3>* Reporting & analytics:</title-3>

<br>

The common thread running through many of these trends is the use of real-time data analytics to make decisions, create a more customer-centric business model and minimize costs while increasing efficiency. Using this data allows companies to know what the current demand is, where to focus, and provide near real-time updates on where supplies or shipments are and when they will arrive at their destination.

<br>

<title-3>* Use of blockchain in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/custom-inventory-management-system"> inventory management: </a></title-3>

<br>

Although blockchain was not designed to help warehouses improve and optimize inventory management, the technology is adept at both tasks. Blockchain allows warehouses, manufacturers, suppliers and production sites, distribution centers, and retail partners to connect with each other through a permanent record of every transaction that takes place. All records are stored and accessible to everyone within the network.

<br>

<title-3>* Stock forecast:</title-3>

<br>

Inventory forecasting occurs when a company uses historical data and analyzes trends to predict and plan its future inventory requirements. In this way, it ensures that it can produce the goods it manufactures or sells in the right quantities to meet demand.

<br>

<title-3>* Hybrid warehousing & shipping:</title-3>

<br>

A hybrid warehouse combines multiple activities, some typical - warehousing, order picking, shipping - and some not so common, as is the case, for example, where some large warehouses have converted unused space into drop-shipping locations. 

Their goal is to maximize space and make delivery and shipping operations more efficient.

<br>

<title-3>* Customization based on customer habits:</title-3>

<br>

Personalization in inventory management is all about gaining a deep understanding of customers' buying habits, in order to stock and suggest relevant products and ensure a seamless experience based on past behavior. A robust inventory management system enables companies to leverage personalization data to drive sales.  Undoubtedly, personalization in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/custom-inventory-management-system"> inventory management software </a> will be a great advantage for those who adjust all these tools to their services, as this generates greater efficiency and productivity for them as a company.

Understanding inventory models will help companies maximize resources, manage costs and deliver quality products to customers on time, and is the first step to effective <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/custom-inventory-management-system"> inventory management </a>. To maintain and even grow operations, inventory managers need to increase their skills and acquire new data analysis and forecasting capabilities.  These systems must be able to manage inventories, help accumulate and analyze data, only in this way can you maintain high service standards so that your company can be on everyone's lips and become the market powerhouse you have always wanted it to be.
