Quality CRM can help bridge the gap between buyer and seller. Trusting in such a system and the entire organization is the key to gaining and retaining customers. If you expect customers to be loyal to you, be prepared to build trust.

In every business, trust and reliability go hand in hand with loyalty.

<title-3>How Can a Customer Trust a Brand He Has Never Seen?</title-3>

Take car service for example. They say that trust in a service worker is crucial here. The question is, how to trust someone you have never seen? At the reception of the vehicle, you will be met by a service <span style="text-decoration:underline;">advisor</span> who will briefly write down your problem/request and pass it on/retell it to the worker, who will then intervene. You get information that the car has been repaired and the bill. Without much explanation, without too much <span style="text-decoration:underline;">overtalking</span>, or any additional information or, "God forbid," advice. Does such a relationship instill confidence in you? Remember that changing the service is a very straightforward operation -- you go to another service you trust more. One service instantly loses a customer, and the other gains a customer. There are many services, and the client can choose. The competition is fierce, and the costs of changing services are minimal. It is similar in other industries.

How can a buyer, a customer, trust a worker when they have never seen one? Who has to build a relationship of trust and loyalty? Who is the crucial point of contact in car service? Worker, manager, or service advisor? When should the most time (and money) be spent to be trained to provide maximum quality and customer care at all times? A local worker intuitively has a CRM system in his head, but what about excellent services? How can quality CRM help bridge the gap between workers and customers? Why is trust in such a system (and the organization consequently) the key to gaining and retaining customers?

<title-3>People, Relationships, Trust</title-3>

Relationship management, customer care, and the always important 'human element' are the focus of organizations. Both buyers and sellers agree that providing added value through service, customer care, and trust are critical competitive success factors. It costs more to get a new buyer than to keep an existing one. Relationships of any kind, even with customers, are complex. Every relationship is an opportunity to learn and build trust through mutual exchange.

Trust is key. It is hard to obtain and relatively simple to go away. The customer must see and feel the care. Otherwise, it is another nice phrase on paper or the site. "You say you love me, but I don't see it in your gestures", is a common topic in interpersonal relationships and represents their essence. So, the nature of all relationships is trust, the way it is perceived, determined, exchanged, and experienced. Trust develops throughout time as a result of both cognitive and emotional causes. It is strengthened by fulfilling promises. The more the customer trusts you, the more often they will buy from you again. When the supply is vast, and there are few customers, it is [increasingly important to build relationships with customers](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/customer-relationship). Indeed, not all relationships are the same: some require more and some less effort. However, everyone must be nurtured to last. This is where CRM comes into play as a system that helps manage customer relationships.

<title-3>Remind Me\... What Is CRM All About</title-3>

There are many definitions of CRM. At the most superficial level, it is a customer database, much like an [email subscriber database that is collected and sorted](https://www.websiteplanet.com/email-marketing-services/verticalresponse/), often with the added help of tools like VerticalResponse. It is then turned into a newsletter as part of a marketing strategy aiming to nurture old and gain new clients.

At the strategic level, CRM describes overall user experience management. At the rational level, the definition of CRM is to optimize customer satisfaction within limited resources, taking into account profitability. At the conceptual level, CRM is conceived as a comprehensive, integrated strategy that includes identifying, gaining, and retaining customers to create a profitable, loyal customer through processes and services that bring value to both the customer and the organization.

<br>

<title-3>CRM as a Huge Undertaking for Many Organizations</title-3>

The CRM system is designed to create, build, and [maintain customer relationships through a well-designed organizational structure](https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/what-is-crm-software/), business processes, and customer-oriented policies -- supported by IT and software solutions. CRM is a comprehensive organization strategy focused on the customer. This is a massive undertaking for many organizations. Customer-oriented business requires adjusting the mental attitude in all parts of the organization. It requires a lot of commitment and often more than it seems at first glance. Therefore, there is a gap between the desire for the customer to be in the center of attention and the possibility of achieving that in practice.

At the most basic level, every organization must know: who are their customers? Where are they? What are their motives for buying? Why are they buying from you? Why are they buying from you again? The answers to these questions represent the CRM journey's beginning.

<br>

<title-3>CRM as a Customer-oriented Business Strategy</title-3>

Many traditional organizations often focus on the product, not the customer. Employees are motivated to maintain existing systems, and the customer is viewed through the prism of these and such systems. Customer needs often remain in oblivion, and the staff attempts to help within the existing system. Is this something you have heard before: "We'd like to aid you, but the system won't let us?" Which system? Who made that system? How to improve the system? Why is the system designed in a certain way? Was the plan established a few years ago to achieve the company's goals today? This is a common situation, unfortunately.

CRM is a customer-oriented business strategy everyone can understand in layman's terms. The customer is the center of attention, not the product. You can have CRM without a software solution. Of course, the software helps in structuring, searching, organizing, and using customer information. It helps gather customer information, their wishes, opportunities, desires, requests, complaints, and grievances (perhaps most important). A CRM system, even if it is informational, helps to build trust through its proper use.

If CRM helps build trust, why does not every organization have one? The answer is simple and logical: every company has a CRM, i.e., a customer relationship management system. The thing is -- these systems are often not software. Sometimes it\'s just paper and pencil. Is that, however, sufficient today? Why does not every company have a CRM software system? Why those who tried did not apply CRM software all the way? Why do organizations still doubt the benefits that CRM software can bring?

<br>

<title-3> Why Do CRM Implementations Fail?</title-3>

CRM software solutions are complex. Due to its complexity, there are many potential points of failure, i.e., risks that must be managed. Several critical reasons for the loss of CRM software implementations do not differ much from any other complex performance (ERP, for example). These are just a handful of the more important ones:

- poor goal setting and expectations,

- lack of support from top management,

- inadequate planning and background of the scope of the project,

- skipped steps during implementation,

- poor change management and subsequent operational use of the system
  > after implementation.

One of the most common problems is inadequate analysis and assessment of business processes, especially in identifying critical methods for building customer trust. It is often insisted on mapping existing business processes into a new system without analyzing whether those processes are efficient, suitable for the new system, and whether something can be improved. On the other hand, key strategies that bring an organization a competitive advantage are often underestimated and try to fit into the generic processes of a software CRM system under the slogan 'best practice'. Some methods need to be updated, upgraded, and some need to be maintained.

Which processes should be improved, which should be maintained, and which should be eliminated should be the subject of analysis before the start of implementation, after getting acquainted with the possibilities of the chosen CRM solution.

<br>

<title-3> The Old Way of Working Implemented in the New System? It Does Not Work</title-3>

The next problem is that people in organizations are used to doing things one way and then devoting too much time to transferring that same way to the new system. This can often be seen in examples where it is insisted that the CRM system be refined to maintain the way it works without analyzing whether (primarily expensive) refinements make sense for the company's strategic goals to be achieved by CRM. And a lot of time and money is wasted there.

CRM software implementations not in line with the CRM organizational strategy are likely to increase operational efficiency but rarely bring a critical competitive advantage. The question is -- is it more important to enter data faster and get reports easier than what the data is and which reports and what they 'say'? Often the problem is in this part. First, it is necessary to clearly and unambiguously define the key objectives, then determine which reports (and the information available in them) contribute to the achievement of these objectives, and from that, it will be clear what data is needed. In CRM, this is the key -- start with what you want, not what you can get from any solution.

The crucial question is -- do you buy CRM software because it gives you 'practical experience,' or do you have your own experience that you want to test and upgrade with a software solution?

<br>

<title-3>How to Successfully Implement CRM</title-3>

Here are some key points to look at and work out if you want to implement CRM both software-wise and mentally successfully:

- Get the support of top management.

- Define a strategic framework and customer-oriented business goals.

- Build a team that includes both business and IT people.

- Think about what a 'customer in the spotlight' means to you.

- Make a plan according to the strategy.

- Implement crucial things and start using them; add the rest over

  > time. Everything is not for immediate implementation.

- Avoid technological pitfalls. Do not be fascinated by technology. Be
  > mesmerized by your goals; technology is there to support them.

<title-3>Conclusion</title-3>

As with all complex solutions, so it is with CRM: the point is not only whether or not you can buy something but also who can implement it. Of course, you can buy everything online. There have been no borders for a long time about this. Still, think about who you would call for support? Who should be contacted in case an issue appears? What if you want to expand and customize your CRM solution in the context of retaining key processes that give you a competitive advantage and do not fit in with 'best practices? What language will be used for communication? Can anyone who needs to use a CRM will use it in that particular language?

One thing is for sure: there is no business without customers. Without customers who trust you, there is no long-term business. Because of this, a CRM strategy supported by the software is a condition without which one cannot participate in the market 'game' today.
