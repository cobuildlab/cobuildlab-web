<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/artificial-intelligence-development/">  AI services  </a> are now evident in most companies, regardless of business size. 

Consumers have incredibly high expectations, so they need to deliver faster, more personalized experiences. Artificial intelligence solutions help you with this. 

Even if you have a commercial software product, you must consider AI as an option to develop a disruptive but robust tool. 

Tools such <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-chatbots-how-do-they-work-and-how-they-benefit-your-business/">   as chatbots </a>, which serve consumers through digital channels and recommend content or services based on automated data analysis.

Like this, there are many other reasons why you should implement artificial intelligence in your startup or company. **Here's how and why to use AI** in these spaces.

<br>

<title-2> Why should a startup use AI?</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Helps in decision making:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-and-machine-learning-trends-to-watch-in-2022/">   Artificial intelligence </a> gives companies a clearer view of their target demographics, which allows them to make better decisions. 

Most companies receive vast amounts of data every day as they analyze their market and consumers, and a good company would be able to glean insights from all the data it collects from its resources. 

AI allows you to translate the data you receive every day to get to know your customers better and keep up with trends. That's why it's essential to establish advanced business processes that implement AI technologies. It improves your operational decision-making and keeps up with the latest consumer demands.

<br>

<title-3>* Plan and track your work with AI:</title-3>

<br>

As a startup, you probably have countless to-dos on your list, small projects in your backlog, and big ideas. It can be challenging to keep it all organized, but with AI software, you can start to automatically allocate your time, just as it intelligently groups and times your plans and projects. 

You enter your data sources, and the system creates a detailed timesheet. You can start planning your resources and suggest how to optimize your time.

<br>

<title-3>* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/cybersecurity-&-artificial-intelligence-how-can-they-benefit-your-business/">   Data Security: </a></title-3>

<br>

AI security systems can detect fraud and notify business owners whenever hackers attempt to access protected or personal data. 

Now, companies can exploit services such as machine learning, data processing automation, and natural language understanding. All these services can help detect unauthorized access attempts before any data breach occurs, saving companies money.

<br>

<title-3>* Human and machine cooperation:</title-3>

<br>

AI is best used to replace or drive low-level tasks that are repetitive or time-consuming. 

However, it has not been created to replace human capabilities; if anything, AI technologies work best when implemented with human efforts. 

Therefore, these intelligent services enhance human-machine interactions and create a workflow of both computational and human efforts. AI is mighty when used to augment operations rather than replace employees' work. It helps companies save time and money by streamlining time-consuming tasks that generally require outsourcing employees to complete.

<br>

<title-3>* Data mining:</title-3>

<br>

Data mining is one of the best uses of artificial intelligence. Not enough people talk about how powerful these technologies can be when used in data mining. 

AI applications and software can now provide valuable findings simply by processing digital interactions and activity data.

<br>

<title-2>Types of AI and common uses for startups</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Functional AI:</title-3>

<br>

Functional AI is very similar to analytical AI. it also scans vast amounts of data and looks for patterns and dependencies. 

However, instead of giving recommendations, functional AI performs actions. Being part of the IoT cloud can detect a fault pattern in the sensor data received from a given machine and trigger a command to shut it down.

<br>

<title-3>* Interactive AI:</title-3>

<br>

This type of AI allows companies to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/improve-communications-to-increase-team-productivity-by-developing-custom-software/">   automate communication </a> without compromising interactivity. 

To imagine this type of AI, think of chatbots and intelligent personal assistants, whose capabilities can range from answering preset questions to understanding the context of the conversation.

<br>

<title-3>* Text AI:</title-3>

<br>

Companies using text AI can enjoy text recognition, speech-to-text conversion, machine translation, and content generation capabilities. 

Unlike a traditional knowledge base that relies on a keyword search, an AI-powered one can find the document that contains the most relevant answer even if the record does not have complete keywords. 

It is made possible by semantic search and natural language processing, which enable AI to build semantic maps and recognize synonyms to understand the context of the user's question.

<br>

<title-3>* Visual AI:</title-3>

<br>

Companies can identify, recognize, classify, and sort objects with visual AI or convert images and videos into knowledge. 

This type of AI encompasses the fields of computer vision or augmented reality. It can be used for facial identification, help companies manage damage visually, or detect flaws in a product that are not invisible to the human eye; its use is infinite.

<br>

<title-3>* Analytic AI:</title-3>

<br>

Thanks to machine learning, including its more advanced deep learning techniques, analytical AI scans tons of data for dependencies and patterns to ultimately produce recommendations or provide a company with insights, thus contributing to data-driven decision-making. Sentiment analysis and supplier risk assessment are just a few examples of analytical AI in action.

Artificial intelligence has been a reality in companies and startups, and you'll be out of fashion if you don't start applying it. 

As this technology develops, the world will demand new startups, business applications, and intelligence to enhance better experiences in each real-life aspect.
