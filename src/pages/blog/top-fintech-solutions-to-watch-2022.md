<br>

<title-2>Some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> Fintech solutions </a> and predictions for 2022:</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>The rise of integrated finance:</title-3>

<br>

Integrated finance has taken the financial world by storm, and its growth will likely continue throughout 2022. The term describes the seamless integration of financial services into a traditionally non-financial platform.

<br>

We all know that covid led to a massive increase in home deliveries, and with it came a corresponding expansion of international <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/custom-software-development-facilitates-logistics-for-e-commerce/">   e-commerce </a>. That, in turn, offered significant growth potential for SMEs worldwide. 

But even with all this growth, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/robots-AI-and-machine-learning-for-your-SMB/"> SMEs </a> still have problems with their financial transactions, as there is not yet the necessary offering for these types of transactions, meaning that they are forced to use the often unaffordable solutions designed for businesses. 

Fortunately, new solutions are emerging, such as BaaS platforms that offer services in foreign currencies. It seems that in 2022, there will be an increase in using them with the arrival of new players in the market.

<br>

<title-3>Traditional financial institutions exploring crypto and NFTs:</title-3>

<br>

While many financial analysts focus on how <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/blockchain-world/"> blockchain </a> technology may disrupt banking, it is worth bearing in mind that several banks are jumping on the blockchain bandwagon, mainly due to the extreme returns compared to traditional channels. 

An additional advantage of blockchain is that it provides unbeatable security for both ends of the transaction funnel, especially regarding identity management. 

It is being used more widely to fight fraud and manage regulatory and audit issues. It is important to remember the speed of transactions with blockchain. 

The technology can speed up asset transfers, payments, and even investments, eliminating errors that cause delays and costs.

<br>

Financial companies are always trying to balance two essential aspects of their offering to customers: efficiency and security. With evolving financial regulations in many parts of the world, customer data APIs seem to be the best solution. 

Using platforms as a service essentially means that banks and FinTechs can adapt to regulatory changes with a customized infrastructure, allowing them to embrace the cloud. 

<br>

<title-3>RPA use in fintech:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/rpa-vs-workflow-automation-for-business-processes/"> Robotic process automation </a> can be defined as process automation technology that uses software robots or digital workers to automate tasks humans perform. 

The financial services industry has already implemented <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/robotic-process-automation"> RPA </a> to reduce costs and improve organizational efficiency. In addition, financial institutions have also adopted RPA digital workers to automate various back-end administrative processes such as security checks, customer onboarding, account maintenance, closing, trial balance, credit card and mortgage processing, and more.

<title-3>Artificial intelligence & machine learning:</title-3>

<br>

Banks around the world are trying to incorporate AI into their operations. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-and-machine-learning-trends-to-watch-in-2022/"> AI </a> can also manage growing cybercrime by identifying fraud and financial threats. It can also be customer-centric, as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   AI and Machine Learning </a> algorithms can record all interactions with the utmost accuracy and precision. 

It has already started with the massive use of chatbots which have been a resounding success. It is expected that by 2030, sides will reduce their operational expenditure to 22%, thanks to AI.

<title-3>Use of reg-tech:</title-3>

<br>

Reg-Tech is short for Regulatory Technology, which can be defined as managing the regulatory process in the financial sector through technology. The main functions of Reg-Tech are reporting monitoring and compliance. 

Reg-Tech empowers companies with the power of advanced software that can simplify the process of complying with current regulations and laws. With the help of Big Data and Machine Learning technology. 

Reg-Tech can provide crucial data on money laundering activities, thereby reducing the risk associated with the company's compliance department. In addition, Reg-Tech can also reduce administrative costs, ensure financial stability and protect customers.

<br>

<title-3>Increased use of digital-only banks:</title-3>

<br>

Digital-only banks offer various virtual banking services such as P2P transfers, international remittances, contactless MasterCard cards with free transaction fees, and the ability to purchase multiple cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and many more. Digital-only banks have gained immense popularity in a short time. That is because they offer maximum convenience to customers by eliminating tedious paperwork, waiting in long queues, and physically visiting a bank.

<br>

<title-3>Open banking:</title-3>

<br>

Open banking is another exciting and revolutionary technology. It unites both banks and FinTechs by facilitating data interconnection between institutions. 

Open banking is related to PSD2 (Second Payment Services Directive). Available banking forces banks to release data in a standardized and secure way, facilitating the exchange of information between various authorized organizations online. It also allows the control of consumer banking and financial details through third-party applications by exchanging data with the help of AI and APIs.
