When we partner with you to create software solutions, we refine your business flows and make daily life processes and activities efficient and effective. However, the security of these software solutions is a top priority at every development stage and should be carefully considered.  
 
Software security is one of the greatest concerns in the software development outline, a breach of security therein could pose a threat to the software users. These threats are born through software vulnerabilities, although not all vulnerabilities result in potential security risks and threats.   

In this article, we will talk about these software vulnerabilities and the activities of a quality software development vendor to curb possible security compromise.   <br> </br>


<title-3 align="left"> What is Software Vulnerability?   </title-3>

During the software development process, mistakes can occur, possibly harmless, negligible mistakes. However, when these mistakes become loopholes to be taken advantage of, then they are called vulnerabilities. 

These vulnerabilities can be manipulated through malware campaigns and cause a software solution to act in a completely different task. A software vulnerability is a mistake or flaw within the development security process that somebody can exploit to compromise software security.  <br> </br>



<title-3 align="left">  Types Of Software Vulnerabilities  </title-3>

Software vulnerabilities can be problematic, and some of them include: <br> </br>


<title-4 align="left">  SQL Injection  </title-4>
It is one of the most common vulnerabilities whereby malicious code injections can access software database content. When threat agents successfully exploit this, then they can have access to sensitive data and cause harm to the network. <br> </br>

<title-4 align="left">  Broken Authentication  </title-4>
When there is a vulnerability at the user authentication session, credentials and identities can be manipulated to pose a threat. <br> </br>

<title-4 align="left">  Buffer Overflow  </title-4>
It happens when a code is overwritten beyond storage capacity, and threat agents can take advantage of this mistake to access or attack your security system.  <br> </br>

<title-4 align="left">  Security Misconfigurations </title-4>
Security misconfiguration vulnerabilities result from insecure and incomplete configurations that create errors that threat agents can exploit.

Thereâ€™s a vast world of <a target="_blank" href="https://codesigningstore.com/common-software-vulnerabilities">  common software vulnerabilities</a> categorized into different sectors by software developers for easy recognition to understand possible threats that can  compromise the software development processes.  <br> </br>



<title-3 align="left">  Compromise Assessment  </title-3>

Vulnerabilities can be harmless, but when security threat agents exploit them, they become harmful, exposing the software solution and users to risks that may compromise them. Because these vulnerabilities are vast and very common, it is important to carry out regular assessments to identify vulnerability threats and liabilities.

A compromise assessment is the intensive review of a software security network with an intent to discover malware campaigns, security breaches, and attempts at unauthorized access. This assessment exposes vulnerabilities that have been exploited by threat agents and their activities. 

The ideal and effective compromise assessment methodology should:  <br> </br>

<title-4 align="left"> Offer Advanced Solutions  </title-4>
The assessment method should be efficient in identifying and detecting all forms of a malware campaign, remote access tools, security breaches, and attempts at unauthorized access. <br> </br>

<title-4 align="left"> Offer Speed And Efficiency </title-4>
The software development security network can be large. The ideal compromise assessment method should be able to efficiently access this large network within the shortest time frame possible. <br> </br>

<title-4 align="left"> Be Affordable  </title-4>
Vulnerabilities are common, and threat agents are always plotting and seeking access to networks. The software assessment should be affordable so that it can be conducted frequently, possibly once a month. <br> </br>

As soon as a compromise assessment is completed, you can use the collected evidence and findings to develop a proper security response for the network. The evidence verifies the network breach and the extent of the harm done. It enables ease of security response to mitigate identified risks and threats to prevent further damage to the network. Most of these concerns of software vulnerabilities and security networks can be curbed and kept in check by choosing quality software development vendors for your software solution processes. <br> </br>



<title-3 align="centered">  4 Ways A Quality Software Development Vendor Can Help Your Business  </title-3> <br> </br>

A quality software development vendor understands your goals and needs, has probably worked on similar processes, and can provide tailor-made outlines for your intended process. This vendor should: <br> </br>


<title-4 align="left"> 1. Understand the development lifecycle of your software product </title-4>
The software vendor understands the unspoken processes and common mistakes involved through the stages of development, deployment, and maintenance of your product. It ensures the development of <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/custom-software-development">  custom software</a> and critical analysis of security processes required for network efficiency.  <br> </br>

<title-4 align="left"> 2. Be available to help with vulnerability management </title-4>
The vulnerabilities are unavoidable, and a quality software development vendor is equipped with the methods and processes to help you manage and mitigate them. <br> </br>

<title-4 align="left"> 3. Offer standard security protocols </title-4>
The security of your software solution is as important as the development of the product. A quality software development vendor can offer detailed and up-to-date security protocols that ensure your data and software products are safe. These protocols monitor the software for potential risks and the variable ways these risks can change over time through the product life cycle. <br> </br>

<title-4 align="left"> 4. Offer the full range of expert services </title-4>
With the full range of expert talent developing your software product from ideation to solution, there are lower chances of mistakes and exposure to vulnerability threats. These experts understand the risks associated with various development stages and create safe practices to integrate possible solutions even before expected risks and threats. <br> </br>

Every day new ideas intended to improve business flows and life processes are born. These ideas are developed into software solutions such as customer relationship management systems, field service management systems, learning management systems, IT support services, or project management systems. 

Software development vendors offer these solutions under various service categories, including web development, app development, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/cross-platform-development/">  cross-platform development</a>, and app design. However, as exciting as these processes can be, the most important aspect is the security of the entire software development network. 

Security threat agents plow the software development world, seeking vulnerabilities to exploit and compromise to cause harm. You must consider the effect of these threats and choose quality software development vendors for your development processes.
