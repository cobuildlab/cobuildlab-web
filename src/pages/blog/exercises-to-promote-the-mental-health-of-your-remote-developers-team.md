Miami, FL. July 20, 2022

The most crucial health problems in this new decade are mental. Too much work and opportunities also have negative factors. 

**Mental health in remote software developers' teams** is no exception to this reality. Therefore, if you have a team of this nature or plan to have one, we recommend a couple of activities that will benefit them. 

And if you <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   hire remote developers </a> teams, ensure that mental health is a factor you address within the group. The following activities will also help you recognize if this topic is a priority for the company you are hiring. Let's get started!

<br>

<title-2>How many cognitive aspects are part of our "mental health"?</title-2>

<br>

* The input-output system represents our ability to accept and respond to external or internal stimulations. If a team member becomes strangely susceptible to very bright lights or sounds and even to social interactions with the rest of the team, it is a possible sign that this mental health sphere is not functioning correctly. 

* Memory: our brain is a single-core processor, and it is common for developers to overload it sometimes with multitasking.

It is essential to avoid this harmful practice and safeguard mental health in this critical area for developing this demanding work.

* Our imagination represents the video card of the mind. 

It is an ability that, with work, we can develop more and more, but developers and creative workers sometimes overload it with demands because they have many deadlines to meet. 

Establish possible deadlines to avoid collapsing the imagination of your work team. 

* In reality, intelligence is the capacity to think and solve problems or specific situations. 

A healthy mind should count backward from 20 without any problem and at a coherent speed. This cognitive area of mental health can also suffer when we simultaneously try to solve many issues, demanding more than the capacity it naturally possesses. 

* Emotions are the last sphere that impacts the body's physical health, even if we do not believe. 

Maintaining a balance and proper management of emotions is the starting point for mental health.

<title-2>Five activities to promote mental health in your <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/hire-remote-software-developers/">   remote developersâ€™ team </a> </title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Action 1: Alternate concentration and deconcentration modes</title-3>

<br>

Forcing concentration for too long is negative and pushes our cognitive limits. 

Your developers can spend two hours doing activities with deep concentration, such as coding and solving development issues. And then spend at least 30 minutes doing unfocused thinking activities, such as mechanical or repetitive tasks that do not require very complex solutions.

<br>

<title-3>Action 2: Advise your development team to maintain an active lifestyle</title-3>

<br>

Practice at least 20 minutes of exercise per day. 

Mental health is part of physical health. Spending time in front of a computer slows down our systems, so incorporating movement can be healthy. The mind is refreshed, and the body releases endorphins.

<br>

<title-3>Action 3: Promote activities that reinforce teamwork</title-3>

<br>

You can organize different activities for the team to get to know each other better.

Teamwork is everything for a team of remote developers; communication between the different developers is of utmost importance to ensure complete synergy between everyone. When individuals in your group bring their problems to work, it slows down the whole project, prevents them from being creative, and creates a hostile working environment. This is why team members should know each other very well and be able to reach out to each other when the situation calls for it.

<br>

<title-3>Action 4:  Produces oxytocin when your team needs it.</title-3>

<br>

Producing oxytocin is an excellent advantage for the entire development team, as it helps them cope with the pressure of jobs, deadlines, and anything else that is a significant burden for them. It translates into increased production and <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/development-team-is-burned-out/">   performance of the development team </a>, including creativity. One of the ways your team can produce oxytocin is by cooking and eating foods everyone loves.

<br>

<title-3>Action 5: Organizing weekly virtual yoga sessions for your team</title-3>

<br>

Many remote employees find balancing work and personal life difficult, especially when working from home. Offering yoga sessions to remote staff is a fun way to keep the team fit and reduce stress. You can hire an experienced yoga teacher to provide weekly virtual sessions to your team, which can be integrated into the daily office routine.

Employee wellness programs ease your team's workload and keep them healthy and engaged. Since many wellness programs were created assuming that your team would work onsite, it's time to design new programs focused on remote teams.

<br>

It's essential to create a virtual social environment where employees feel free to speak their minds, provide<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/careers/">   personal and professional development </a> training, and offer counseling sessions for those who feel overwhelmed by the demands of work and home. 

Finally, create alternative benefits to replace those who gave up due to telecommuting. Remember that your wellness programs should provide comfort and be fun. The happier and more productive employees will be.
