<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   Artificial Intelligence </a> (AI) is a tool that will drive the next era of human progress; if your company is not up to speed, you may find yourself out of the game for years to come. 

AI is the second most important initiative for business leaders, second only to using data-driven efforts to improve products and services. Here are 7 steps to implement AI in your startup o company. Read on!

<br>

<title-2>Learn more about AI</title-2>

<br>

Take the time to familiarize yourself with what AI can do. It would help if you also took advantage of the wealth of information and online resources available to familiarize yourself with the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/how-and-why-should-a-startup-use-ai/">   basics of AI </a>. 

Anything you can learn about this technology is a plus, as the more you understand it, the more you will master it and be able to implement it in many activities within your company.

<title-2>Step 1: Identify the problems you want to solve with AI</title-2>

<br>

Once you have caught up on the basics, the next step for any entrepreneur is to start exploring different solutions from this technology. 

Knowing your company's issues will help you create ideas to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/artificial-intelligence-development/">   implement IA </a> in these activities and give them a solution. Your answer should be able to show you how natural language processing, image recognition, ML, etc., fit perfectly into your products or services.

<br>

<title-2>Step 2: Prioritize concrete value/solution</title-2>

<br>

It is easy to get lost in discussions about AI because it offers too many possibilities. So remember what solution you need to don't disperse the goal. Your <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/hire-remote-software-developers/">   development team </a> will appreciate this.

A way to do it is based on near-term visibility and the financial value to your startup or company. 

Involve managers and consultants at this step to make the work more accessible.

<br>

<title-2>Step 3: Acknowledge the internal capability gap</title-2>

<br>

What you want and your internal capacity to accomplish in a given timeframe is different. 

A company/startup must know what it is capable of and what it is not from a technology perspective before launching into a full-blown <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/robots-AI-and-machine-learning-for-your-SMB/">   AI </a> implementation. 

Addressing the internal capability gap means identifying what needs to be acquired and what methods must evolve internally before going live. 

This exercise helps you to know if you need a delivery team or staffing.

<br>

<title-2>Step 4: Seek experts and implement a pilot project</title-2>

<br>

Now, it's time to start building and integrating. The most important factors here are starting small, keeping project goals in mind, and, most importantly, being aware of what you know and don't know about AI. 

It is where bringing in outside experts or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alacret/">   AI consultants </a> can be invaluable. 

Once the pilot project is complete, you should be able to decide what the longer-term, more elaborate project will be and whether the value proposition makes sense for you. 

It is also essential that the expertise from both sides, the people who know the business and the people who know AI, are merged into the pilot project team.

Remember: You can add a whole team by outsourcing or hiring an independent professional to develop specific tasks.

<br>

<title-2>Step 5: Create a dynamic working group for data integration</title-2>

<br>

Before implementing IA in your company/startup, it is necessary to clean the data so that it is ready and avoid using information that is not relevant. 

Internal data is often scattered across multiple silos. Therefore, a crucial step to getting high-quality data is to form a cross-functional working group to integrate the different data sets and sort out inconsistencies so that the information is accurate and rich, with all the correct dimensions required for IA.

<br>

<title-2>Step 6: You're ready to start but start small</title-2>

<br>

At this time, you are prepared to go with this step. However, when you are beginning, be selective in your use of AI: that means not throwing all the data you have at hand at your first project and evaluating it as you go along. 

Start with a small sample data set and use AI to demonstrate the value it contains. 

After a few wins behind you, deploy the solution strategically and with full stakeholder support. 

Depending on the results, you can move on to see how your <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Artificial-Intelligence-What-is-it/">   AI </a> performs against a new data set. You can start putting your AI to work with the information you've never used. 

In a few words, implement AI progressive.

<br>

<title-2>Step 7: Build with balance</title-2>

<br>

This may seem obvious, but all too often, AI systems are designed around specific aspects without understanding the requirements and limitations of the hardware and software that would support the research. The result is a less than optimal, even dysfunctional, system that fails to achieve the desired goals. 

Companies must incorporate sufficient bandwidth for storage, graphics processing units (GPU), and networking to achieve this balance. 

Security is often overlooked. AI needs access to vast swaths of data to do its job. Ensure you understand what types of data will be involved in the project and that your usual security safeguards-encryption, virtual private networks, and anti-malware-may not be sufficient.

Your company/startup will become much more comfortable and capable of implementing AI solutions at a certain point. 

These steps are not always easy to follow, as they depend on many factors for AI implementation. Still, they represent a practical framework to help you successfully start your idea.
