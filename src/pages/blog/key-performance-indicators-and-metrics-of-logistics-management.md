Companies spend millions on equipping themselves with logistics software and systems so that their supply chain never fails and is always on the move. 

One of the great advantages of these systems is that they allow you to collect large amounts of data and information for later analysis, but the big question is, are you using that data correctly? Well, if you’re not really sure,  we’ll show you some indicators and metrics and you will learn how to take advantage of all these **metrics of logistics management** for the good of your company.  

<br>

<title-2>Why is it important to evaluate logistics and supply chain performance in a year?</title-2>

<br>

Key performance indicators, also known as KPIs, are metrics that measure the performance of the main processes executed by a company.  They allow employees to take an in-depth look at each of the processes and activities carried out in the supply chain and see if they are effective, which can lead to higher productivity and profit margins.

In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/what-is-logistics-management-software-and-why-it-will-lead-your-company-to-grow/"> logistics </a>, KPIs are very important for measuring production, cost, and quality rates. Even better, the data obtained by these indicators will be directly reflected in the effectiveness of your company's logistics management, as they allow you to continuously monitor and evaluate all metrics related to your supply chain. 

This is why throughout the whole year you should constantly monitor this information, taking the KPIs as indicators, as this is the only way to obtain the maximum performance of your company.

<title-2>Key logistics metrics for supply chain performance</title-2>

<br>

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/software-trends-for-inventory-management/">   Inventory </a> accuracy:</title-3>

<br>

It measures the accuracy of warehouse workers when picking a product. High accuracy is desired to ensure that the right products go to the right customers. Low inventory accuracy can lead to angry customers and additional costs to fulfill orders. 

<br>

<title-3>Dock to Stock:</title-3>

<br>

It measures the cycle time from the start of a receipt to the time it is put away. This is of utmost importance to track the efficiency of inbound activities and to be able to ensure that your product is available for orders as soon as possible.

<br>

<title-3>Order Accuracy:</title-3>

<br>

Perfect order rate is another very important logistics metric when it comes to the efficiency of your supply chain. It measures the number of orders that are processed, shipped, and delivered without any issues on their way. 

It is important as it shows the efficiency of your supply chain and delivery services, and that leads, of course, to more satisfied customers who are willing to come back or recommend your services.

<br>

<title-3>On-Time Shipping:</title-3>

<br>

It shows the percentage of shipments that left the warehouse on time. All items have tight deliveries with small windows. If a shipment is lost, your customer may be affected by delays.

<br>

<title-3>Cost per Pound:</title-3>

<br>

This metric is responsible for measuring gross net with total weight moved each month/quarter to show buying and usage patterns to customers. This logistics KPI will help your customer continue to buy well. These trends can help them save money, but not over-buy or under-buy. 

<br>

<title-3>Pick & Pack Cycle Time:</title-3>

<br>

Pick and pack cycle time is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/10-kpis-you-should-implement-your-logistics-company-marina-fel%C3%ADcio/"> logistics KPI </a> that tracks the amount of time it takes for an employee to pick an item from a shelf to the point at which the packing process takes place. This metric is calculated by dividing the total amount of time by the total number of items picked and packed in a given period. 

This is valuable information, as it allows you to drill down into that line's process and find out what may be delaying picking and packing. Measuring each line separately also allows you to try different strategies for each line and see which is most effective.

<br>

<title-3>Warehousing Costs:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-powered-robots-for-warehousing/"> Warehousing </a> is the management of space and time. Warehousing costs refer to the money allocated to goods that are moved in or out of the warehouse. These costs cover equipment and energy costs such as ordering, storing, and loading goods, as well as more human costs such as labor, shipping, or delivery. 

Measuring them is not an easy task, but once done it will facilitate your overall management and add a lot of value, something that top management or investors will appreciate.

<title-2>How can you use this information next year?</title-2>

<br>

Analyzing the data and information provided by the systems and analyzing them taking into account the metrics is undoubtedly a great strategy in the business world because with this you will have a broader view of your entire supply chain and you will understand why some things are so, what is wrong and what is right. Ideally, KPI data will provide insight into a problem or opportunity in the field that you can address to improve your team's performance.  

The planning component involves analyzing the KPI data to decide when, where, and with whom you will address that opportunity, and what exact steps you should take to achieve the greatest impact.

KPIs are just one way to collect the data you need to fuel the continuous improvement cycle that will help you and your team succeed on the ground. The cyclical process drives peak performance and enables you and your team to make data-backed decisions with proven results. 

Quality and continuous improvement require measuring <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Supply-chain-synchronization/"> supply chain </a> performance to ensure that operations are customer-focused and profitable. You must analyze performance to assess efficiency and productivity, thus ensuring your company's competitiveness. 

As you can see, the main goal of this measurement is to know the status of processes and their evolution to make better decisions regarding efficiency, expenses, time, and customer satisfaction.
