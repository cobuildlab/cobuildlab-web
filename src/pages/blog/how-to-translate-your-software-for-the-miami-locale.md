This article will discuss how translating your software can significantly increase your local users and what your considerations are when doing so. According to a study conducted by CSA Research, about 40% said they would not buy products or services not in their native language, while 65% have said that they preferred content in their language even if it was of poor quality. So it isn't much of a stretch that non-native English-speaking users would still choose to have software in their mother tongue. If you want to learn about this and how you can translate your software for the Miami locale, then keep on reading!  

<title-3 align="centered">  Miami's local software industry  </title-3>

According to <a target="_blank" href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/why-miami-is-the-next-hot-tech-hub/"> Crunchbase News</a>, the last year saw high-profile investors like Keith Rabois, the general partner of Founders Fund, and David Blumberg, Blumberg Capital founder. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez started promoting the area as a tech hub due to Miami's lack of state income tax, making it appealing to many investors and start-up founders. Even though Miami's tech industry isn't as booming as San Francisco's, many start-up founders and investors could cause the tech industry to dramatically grow in Miami. However, the pandemic has caused many to reassess the current situation in their industry. It has also accelerated the migration of founders and investors in Miami. It is noted by David Goldberg, Alpaca VC's general partner, that even though Miami is not going to overtake Silicon Valley in the immediate future, it has an opportunity to collaborate with other tech ecosystems. Miami raised $972 million across 52 deals in 2020, and final figures could increase. An example of the potential of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.designrush.com/agency/software-development/florida/miami">software industry in Miami</a> was featured by CobuildLab, in which it showcased <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/We-introduce-you-to-Octopi/"> a Miami-based software start-up specializing</a> in smart Terminal Operating Systems (TOS) that assist small to medium-size seaport operators in managing their operations like tracking cargo and communicating real-time with their commercial partners. The versatile nature of software is helping other local industries in Miami to flourish.

The software and software-enabled companies are a diverse group of entrepreneurial businesses in Miami. Even though they’re primarily focused on different types of customers, they are unified through similar talent, for example, UX designers and developers. From 2018 to 2016, the projected growth of the software industry in Miami was at 15.6%, the highest of all Miami industries. There's a lot of potential for this industry to continue to grow. One way of promoting software and other software-related companies is by having their software in different languages. Interestingly enough, the advertisement industry in Florida is heavily influenced by the Spanish-language television network. Suppose you ever plan to promote your software locally. This is substantially essential information because this means that the Miami locale doesn't follow conventional US advertisement tactics but  is rather more influenced by immigrant ones.   <br> </br>


<title-3 align="centered">  Should you translate your software?  </title-3>

As previously mentioned, the advertisement industry of Miami is heavily influenced by Spanish-language networks. This is a strong indicator that the local sector within Miami is very diverse. According to Florida Trend, about 40.5% of Miami consists of foreign-born residents. Due to this, Miami is ranked second amongst US metros for foreign-born residents with a bachelor's degree or advanced degree. There are many foreign-owned businesses with over 2,500 foreign-owned business establishments in the same ranks as Atlanta, Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, DC, and more. One in five Florida residents is an immigrant, while one in eight has one immigrant parent. 
 
Significant data points out that one way of increasing customer and user interaction is by translating or localizing goods and services to a diverse audience. Based on the research conducted by CSA Research, it saw that the respondents were given similar products and 76% of them chose the product in their native language. CSA Research also discovered that Fortune 500 companies that invested in translation had a 2.04 times improvement in profits and generated a 1.27 times higher earnings per share. At the same time, Forrester Research saw that consumer brands would move "toward localized, automated and retention-based marketing" that primarily focuses on strategies in customer retention that will encourage current buyers to keep on buying. 

This is further backed by a piece written by Wired entitled, *"Coding Is for Everyone—as Long as You Speak English,"* which featured a noticeable problem that programs and software are primarily in English. This is very problematic because billions of people around the world don't speak the language. Programming language isn't only about technical implementation but also about building a human community. It went so far as to compare English to Latin because both languages have access to traditional knowledge. In contrast, before scholars had to learn Latin, non-English speakers who wish to learn about programming and software development are now being told that they have to learn English if they want to know. History is repeating itself. This doesn't have to be the case as we already have the means for software development to be more available in different languages. <br> </br>


<title-3 align="centered">  Hire translation services in Miami to create a multilingual software  </title-3>

Hiring professionals to do the job is in itself a good investment in the long run. Because Miami has a diverse population, you need to search for translation services in Miami that can<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tomedes.com/locations/miami-translation-services/"> efficiently implement a wide range of languages into any software</a>. As previously mentioned, many experts have pointed out that translating your product and services in different languages increases customers and helps retain them. 

One such company that shares this sentiment is Tomedes, a translation services provider in Miami. They have pointed out that Miami has a diverse local scenery with over 128 languages being spoken by its residents and about 60% of Miami's population speaking Spanish. By making your software available in different languages, you're potentially tapping into local communities that, through conventional means, would be unviable. Even though Slator discusses the checkout page, it showed that 9 out of 10 had lost sales in Europe. This was because 74% of these checkouts did not have the local language translation, which led to the purchase failure. Just like this example, when it comes to software, UX is significant. If your customers don't understand how your software works, it will be removed or uninstalled.  <br> </br>


<title-3 align="centered">  Other considerations in creating a multilingual software  </title-3>

At the heart of creating multilingual software there is research from the target locale and the logistics involved in creating software in different languages. There are several considerations that CobuildLab wrote about like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/why-software-testing-is-crucial-for-digital-transformation/"> software testing</a>, the effect of digital transformation on business, quality assurance process, and more. We've listed here some other things you have to take into account if you're planning to create multilingual software, as follows:

▪️ Look into internationalization as it involves stripping away the software to one language or location. This consists of the application framework, dynamic UI expansion, coding for the string localization, and more.

▪️ Localization process including resource file extraction, translation, quality review, and insertion into code. 

▪️ Localization testing is essential. In this phase, you will have to catch any problems with the updates or changes made to the software, like errors or bugs.

▪️ Research the CAT tools and other tools you can apply to your software that could efficiently incorporate translation into it. <br> </br>


<title-3 align="centered"> Key Takeaway   </title-3>

Miami in recent years has become a tech hub, and given how competitive the Miami market is, how can you stand out? One way of attracting new customers and retaining them is by creating multilingual software to help non-native English speakers in Miami better understand how your software works. By having multilingual software readily available to the Miami population, you're not only ensuring that Miami becomes fully immersed in this IoT age but helping start the dialogue in making the software community more multilingually diverse.
