IT staff augmentation is adding an external team (usually composed of <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/hire-remote-software-developers/">   remote developers </a>) to a company's regular staff on a full or part-time basis. It can be done on both a short-term and long-term basis, as most staff augmentation developers work on a project basis, as well as for a set period, depending on the company's specific needs. <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/best-practices-to-follow-when-you-use-software-development-for-staff-augmentation/">   IT staff augmentation </a> brings the opportunity to hire skilled IT professionals without committing to location restrictions or a traditional long-term employment contract.

<title-2>Best Practices of Staff Augmentation</title-2>

<br>

* **Communication is Essential for Success:** As with any other workplace endeavor, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/improve-communications-to-increase-team-productivity-by-developing-custom-software/">   effective communication </a> is critical when working with an augmented staff. Any staffing company worth its salt works hard to maintain an open line of communication with clients, but this exchange of information works both ways. Your team must work closely and openly with your staffing agency to outline what type of talent is needed, what your project entails, and whether any issues arise along the way.

* **Clarify requirements to save time and effort:** Developing a clear idea of what you expect from candidates and positions is crucial. And it is no less essential to convey this idea to your service provider and discuss the details before starting the hiring process.

We often only have a list of skills and technology stack. That's why we always start with an interview with the client and try to learn as much as possible about the roles, responsibilities, and project details.

* **Don't wait up or you risk missing a perfect candidate:** You had a final interview with a candidate and considered making an offer. At this point, we recommend not dragging it out and making your decisions within days. Otherwise, you may risk losing a perfect candidate. It's a cut-throat competition out there, and even a short delay may result in your ideal candidate accepting a counteroffer from another company.

* **Create team synergy:** It's essential to integrate new people into your team and share all necessary information about the project, its goals, progress, and everyone's role in the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/enterprise-software-development/">   development process </a>. You can reach this by setting transparent communication and collaboration practices, team building and training activities, etc. We also suggest arranging regular personal meetings for all team members if possible.

* **Embrace Clear Standards and Thorough Documentation:** Clarity is vital when working with augmented staff members. What may seem obvious to those in the know in your company may be a bit difficult for new starters, so be sure to give your augmented staff members precise requirements and guidelines. Your team may also benefit from more thorough documentation. Copious notes, reports, and emails ensure that your team is kept up to date even after temporary staff members leave.

* **Team Up With an Experienced Agency for Staff Augmentation Services:** Filling vacancies is often a challenge, especially when it comes to temporary positions. Staff augmentation takes the guesswork and frustration out of expanding your team, but you should work with an experienced staffing firm to get the full benefits of an increased workforce.
