A newsletter is a digital publication that you can make daily, weekly, monthly, even every two or three months. This publication may include posts of your blog or digital platform, or updates of your business.

Newsletters are really important especially if you want to keep a close relationship with your customers. It is a good option to give them valuable information, connecting with their interests, and keeping communication with theirs.

<title-2>How to properly do a Newsletter</title-2>

<title-3>1. Plan</title-3>

A newsletter is a kind of an email marketing campaign, and every campaign has to plan it. 

The goal, the segmentation, the customer profile you want to catch, etc. It is recommendable if you make a plan monthly. In effect, when the month begins, you plan the campaigns for the whole month and you will save time without mentioning that you will work with a certain base. 

We love a technique for making a specific segmentation and use the right words, images, and content for your customer’s profile. 

The technique is the Buyer Persona and it is an ideal client archetype. You have to create a character, with a name, likes, behaviors, with a specific work, age, preferences, gender, and every aspect that a human has. 

That will be your perfect client. And you need to think as he or she and plan the newsletter based on what, how, when and for what they should read you.


<title-3>2. Give it a name</title-3> 

This It will give power to your newsletter. When we say give It a name, we are talking about a campaign name or just a subject. It is an email, you have to do It if you don't want to slip past.

This step will be easier if you define well all characteristics and the behavior of your potential customers. You could choose the better day and hour to [send the newsletter](https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-email-marketing-software-services/), taking in consideration when you think that they Will be free and willing to read. 

Pd: Weekends or Mondays usually are the best days for this. But remember, everything Will depend on your audience. 

<title-3>4. Select the content</title-3>

The content for newsletters usually comes from a blog or post on a web platform. 

Depending on your goals choose the best content that helps you accomplish every goal. 

For example, if you have an app that helps to organize the time and people's lives, and your goal is to show how your product works, a good content that you can share through a newsletter is the importance of being organized in life. How to do it. Benefits, some tips that help, some motivating quotes, and of course some apps which make this goal possible. Even, you could make a step by step to use It.

In that way, you share important and valuable information, you don't sell directly, and the best, you will achieve your goal. 

All of this information, of course, should be on your blog. A newsletter just put the information together to send it.


<title-3>5. Write a description or a summary of the question you will answer in every post involved</title-3>

Here is the magic of newsletters. It is a short description but very descriptive and striking. When a user read it, they must be sure of what it is about the article. 

Write an initial paragraph, an introduction. Then, take the main idea of the article and put it together with the goal of the post. 

You can complement this main idea with a fact, or another complementary idea in the post. 

The third step is adding the utility that the information will have for the user, and close the description writing a conclusion. Not too long and not so short!

Follow this structure in every post, and write effective and really good post summaries. 


You also can choose an image to complement it but is not necessary.


<title-3>6. Design it</title-3>

At this point, you would have the plan, the name or subject of the newsletter, the day an hour to send it, the specific articles or content you will share, and the summary of each post. 

Next, you will have to do is the structure of the newsletter. Put the images in the right place. If there is more than one content, well, structure them, put them in order, and separate every post or description, add the links of articles, and make the newsletter more clear and enjoyable for customers. 

There are many tools for doing easier this work, and we will show you later. Continue reading! 

<title-3>7. Test it</title-3>

It is high recommendable sending a test of the newsletter first. When you have finished send it first to your email, check that everything is alright, and then [send the newsletter](https://www.onehourprofessor.com/best-email-marketing-software-services/) to your readers.

Some things you need to keep in mind are the subject can see it complete? , if images work with the alternative text, if there are some broken links or images, if there are some grammatical mistake. The last is so so so important.

They should know that periodically the content you publish on your blog will reach your email.

You can write manually emails of customers, but that’s not the best method. You should have a database where this information is stored, and you just have to import it.

<title-3>9. Analyze its effectiveness and the customer’s acceptance</title-3>

As every marketing campaign, you need to know and measure the results to reinforce hits and correct weakness. 

What you should measure in a newsletter? 

First, the **opening rate** that is the number of people who opened the message divided by the number of people who received it.

Then, measure the **click rate**. This is the number of clicks on a link in the newsletter divided by the number of people who received it. 

And last, the **conversion rate**. This is all people who made some conversion from the newsletter.
