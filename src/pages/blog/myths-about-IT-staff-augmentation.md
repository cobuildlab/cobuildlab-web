<title-2>7 myths about IT staff augmentation</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Staff augmentation is quite expensive</title-3>

<br>

❌​Not true. It is more cost-effective to deal with outsourced companies than to undertake a massive increase in internal IT staff. 

Staff augmentation allows companies to bypass most direct and indirect costs affecting in-house employees, including insurance and retirement benefits, staff compensation, legal processes, and office supply management. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/staff-augmentation-vs-dedicated-team/">  Staff augmentation </a> plays a massive role in risk and resource management, far beyond cost savings. 

Ensure your IT staff members have effective hiring processes to access the region's best talent. 

It eliminates the risk of hiring the wrong person for the job and provides a seamless process between sourcing and hiring. The time savings help companies focus on their core competencies.

<br>

<title-3>Management & communication-related issues</title-3>

<br>

Usually, off-shore teams offer services based out of distinctive locations. 

Concerning the same, many employers think that it will be a cumbersome affair to communicate in different time zones. As a result, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/improve-communications-to-increase-team-productivity-by-developing-custom-software/"> project-related communication </a> will hamper to a great extent, but this is not 100% real.

There are technological tools of communication are the solution to deal with this issue. 

The business professionals and the augmented teams can seamlessly collaborate remotely without obstacles. Communicate with augmented staff on scheduled timing and from any location to streamline the work process. Off-shoring and nearshore have become more popular than ever, involving talent in other areas but a better balance in cost-benefit. <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/"> Remote IT talent </a> is a new normal, and many success stories prove that communication is not an obstacle. 

<br>

<title-3>You don’t have control over your project❌​</title-3>

<br>

Another widely held belief is that you lose control of the project with staff augmentation. You "hand over power" to the company you hire for conventional outsourcing. You have "very little control" over the success or the path the project should take until it is completed. 

If you work with the right team, this won't happen. 

If you hire an external IT team, they must follow your action plan or build one, following your goals, expectations, and needs. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/staff-augmentation-vs-project-outsourcing/"> Staff augmentation </a> allows you to maintain complete control over the course and development of the project. 

This is an order to them when you decide to take a chance or correct anything. That's the IT staff team works hand in hand with your internal talent. 

Dedicated developer teams are next door, and you have direct contact with the project manager and developers.

<br>

<title-3>Time/cultural differences are too much challenging</title-3>

<br>

This refers to the fact that staff augmentation equipment working in different locations may have many time zones. 

Employers must follow their time zones when working with an external resourcing partner. 

However, this is a myth and completely contradicts itself. Today, you have tools and other means to schedule collaboration times and schedule calls. 

In addition, your provider must choose talent with your same timezone if it is your desire. 

There would be no shortage of time or differences when working with remote teams. 

Also, on the cultural side, there could be some differences. It could be a different culture from foreign-based employers, but this can help team members learn about new cultures and helps you get to know them better.

<br>

<title-3>Low-quality development</title-3>

<br>

Some believe that IT staff augmentation services result in poor quality work and lower <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/how-to-be-a-better-software-developer-5-steps-that-will-improve-your-lifestyle-and-productivity/"> productivity </a>. 

This is because the remote team takes longer to complete development due to working in different time zones. In addition, the project will not turn out as expected. 

On the contrary, the increased staff supports your particular <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/price-calculator/"> software development project</a> more diligently. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/hire-remote-software-developers/"> Remote teams </a> offer flexible working hours, are dedicated to your project, and are more accountable. 

Also, you add to your team better talent in a broader territorial range, even globally. 

As mentioned above, augmented teams are under your control to manage, disperse tasks and scale up and down accordingly. 

<br>

<title-3>Manage IT staff augmentation teams is a challenging task</title-3>

<br>

Unless an organization can not schedule performance meetings and monitor key performance metrics, it is clear that this cannot be true. 

Staff augmentation teams are prepared to assimilate in a short time into new environments and morph into the structure and procedures of the project or organization they work for. Physical distances are no longer an issue. 

Operating with outsiders is naturally a bit scary, but if the benefits of staff augmentation are taken into account, those concerns will be overshadowed. However, having all essential matters in writing and always using transparent and effective communication channels is good advice.

<br>

<title-3>It’s hard to get tech support for the follow-up</title-3>

<br>

When the project is finished and the team is no longer staffed with more people, who will provide technical support? This is one of the most forward-thinking entrepreneurs. A reputable outsourcing company will provide solutions and support options.

While this is a type of outsourcing, it offers a better way to build and maintain a project.
