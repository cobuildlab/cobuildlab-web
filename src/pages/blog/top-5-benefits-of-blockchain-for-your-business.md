<title-2>5 benefits of using blockchain in your business</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Better Traceability:</title-3>

<br>

Today, thanks to the blockchain, it is easier to track any product or merchandise during shipment and throughout the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Tips-for-Managing-the-Supply-Chain-after-a-Pandemic/"> supply chain </a>.  The information related to the component can then be transmitted to or from the new owner for possible action.  It also allows knowing more in detail this product as its characteristics, its place of origin, to know if it is original, especially in markets where counterfeiting abounds, and even to know the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/why-machine-learning-applied-to-the-supply-chain-will-save-the-planet/">  environmental impact</a> it may cause. With blockchain, it is possible to share provenance data directly with customers. Traceability data can also expose weaknesses in any supply chain, where goods may be sitting on a loading dock waiting to be forwarded.

<br>

<title-3>More Transparency:</title-3>

<br>

In this kind of blockchain transaction these processes become more transparent because as blockchain uses a distributed ledger, transactions and data are recorded identically in multiple locations. Everyone involved in any given transaction can have access to the transaction information, increasing reliability on both sides and helping them understand each other better.

<br>

<title-3>Security:</title-3>

<br>

With digital signatures and encryption of transactions, the blockchain is much more secure than other storage systems. When the data transfer is approved, it is immediately linked to the previous one, and therefore cannot be modified as it is attached to a long chain of numbers once formed. Privacy issues can also be addressed in blockchain by anonymizing personal data and user permissions to prevent access. Information is stored on a network of computers rather than on a single server, making it difficult for hackers to view the data.

<br>

<title-3>Accelerate Automation:</title-3>

<br>

Along with blockchain technology, world-renowned smart contracts can be used to help your efficiency and further accelerate your company's automation process.  These smart contracts do not require human intervention or a third party to verify that all terms of the exchange are met. 

<br>

<title-3>Increases efficiency:</title-3>

<br>

By implementing this technology your company improves and increases its efficiency in general aspects because thanks to this technology many tasks can be streamlined, all this thanks to smart contracts, that transactions are made directly with the two parties involved and don’t depend on a third party or intermediary to perform them, always with a full assurance that each of the agreed terms will be met. This cuts time and saves significantly on operating expenses.
