Data has become a critical <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/business-management-system-more-effective/">   business</a> resource and is captured all the time by the devices we interact with every day, such as credit cards, surveillance cameras, and, of course, the cell phone. It makes data grow exponentially, and the goal is to figure out how to find the data scattered inside and outside the enterprise. According to studies, some 463 exabytes of data will be created every day by 2025. <br> </br>

Data is precious to large enterprises. Now, companies can integrate previously invisible data and combine it with meaningful sources to understand their behavior. The use of Big data is growing. In 2017 alone, companies had a 53% increase in this innovative process.

Data now represents a significant source of resources for understanding and manipulating demographic data and the customers’ particular preferences that companies want to reach according to their objectives. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Why-digital-transformation-starts-with-a-software-development-team/">   Technology</a> has been responsible for creating an almost infinite database that represents us. Whether we use it passively or actively, we leave a trace that can later be used in favor of someone or a company by interacting with it. <br> </br>

Big data will change how even the smallest companies do business as data collection and interpretation become more accessible. We used to call new technologies a day-to-day issue with more innovative and cost-effective solutions. Thanks to this constant evolution, companies have taken advantage of big data without any problems.

The use and understanding of big data is a critical competitive advantage for companies that want to lead the market. It is why companies need to consider four <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/digital-transformation-5-trends-to-pay-attention-to-in-2022/">   digital transformation</a> elements when developing strategies to harness data. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>1. Data-driven partnerships</title-4></b>

Business leaders need to connect with experts to create an augmented intelligence strategy. Organizations are increasingly increasing access to talent, especially those that involve technology. It allows a culture of augmented intelligence to be made.

There is a famous saying in business and society: “The balance between the human experience and the power of machines is vital.” When humans work in tandem with technology, previously impossible goals can solve complex business problems and make the employee and customer experience more memorable. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>2. Diagnose and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Benefits-of-Hiring-Custom-Software-Development-Services-to-Automate-Processes/">   improve obsolete processes</a></title-4></b>

Data can create a sustainable basis for decision-making—for example, a way to correct process inefficiencies in process mining. Process mining works by identifying problems through algorithms that analyze system data. When this strategy is applied correctly, it creates a digital twin of operations, showing which methods are working and need adjustment or improvement. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>3. Take advantage of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/cloud-logistics-software-solution/">   power of the cloud</a></title-4></b>

The magic is in collecting, processing, and analyzing data at scale. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/best-cloud-based-solutions-in-the-market-2021/">   cloud</a> is a sustainable technology for digital transformation that enables the analysis of large amounts of information. When companies develop strategies that rely on the use of the cloud, they can collect and analyze external and third-party data and compare it with internal data.

The cloud is a data optimizer and does so behind the scenes, creating powerful customer experiences, such as how Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify adjust their algorithms every day to consider their audience’s interests and preferences. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>4. Apply sector-specific knowledge</title-4></b>

The importance lies in efficient and ethical data management. It is crucial, especially for companies in highly regulated industries, such as financial services. Companies are always aware that data must be handled with extreme security, complying with regulations and possible industry biases.

Business functions must be perfectly aligned in this case, as significant effort is required to create data collection strategies that respect each sector’s privacy, social, and business norms. <br> </br>

Big data and its tremendous advantages have been crucial for many companies to lead the market and outperform their competitors. New entrants and established competitors use data-driven strategies to compete, engage, and innovate in many industries. Big data can be used in almost every sector, from IT to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/ai-for-health-healthcare-support/">   healthcare</a>.

According to experts, Big Data can create a wealth of new growth opportunities. It may even give rise to a new category of companies, such as analyzing and aggregating industry data. These companies will find themselves amid large information streams about services and products, suppliers and buyers, consumer intentions and preferences, etc. Companies in all sectors should start aggressively developing their Big Data capabilities.

Consumers are savvy and know their priorities. Before making a purchase, consumers search and compare different options.

Big Data enables a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Business-Model-vs-Business-Strategy-for-a-Software-Company/">   business organization</a> to build a robust profile of its customers. It allows a company to engage in real-time, one-on-one conversations with consumers. It is not a luxury. You have to treat customers the way they want to be treated.

Companies are increasingly trying to leverage all that data to help drive better business strategies and decisions. In a survey conducted by consulting firm NewVantage Partners in late 2020 among IT and business executives at 85 large enterprises, 91.9% said they were accelerating the pace of their investments in big data and related <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Artificial-Intelligence-Do-For-Your-Small-Business/">   AI initiatives</a>, while 96% reported successful outcomes from such projects.
