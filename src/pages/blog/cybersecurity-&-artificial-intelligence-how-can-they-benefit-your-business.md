Cybersecurity solutions need to take advantage of technological advances to combat the growing threat of cyberattacks. That is why following the complexity and volume of cyberattacks, working together with artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to change the game and increase the defense capacity of organizations from network vulnerabilities. It is in this panorama that robust detection and prevention tools, known as Threat Intelligence, emerge.

Threat intelligence is evidence-based knowledge, which includes contexts, mechanisms, indicators, implications, and practical advice about an existing or emerging threat or danger to assets, which can be used to make informed decisions about the subject's response to that threat or danger. In a nutshell, it means that Threat Intelligence is a composite of information that an organization can use to understand the threats it has or may have, and therefore, it is data that serves to prepare, prevent and identify possible actors who seek to take advantage of the vulnerabilities of a system. 
It is easy to imagine that for a Cybersecurity team, the compilation of information for the search and detection of threats can be a task arduous and complex that requires the observation of a large amount of information and, therefore, represents a very time-consuming task. Also, it drains a lot of time and effort to detect, eradicate and heal every vulnerability and damage. <br> </br>


<title-3 align="centered">  How can artificial intelligence help threat intelligence?  </title-3>

The human work involved in analyzing and processing information to generate threat intelligence databases involves many resources, both financial and temporal. In this case, artificial intelligence can help manage cyber risks, for example, it can help organizations streamline the time it takes to recover from a security breach and help prevent further losses. Artificial intelligence has the implicit ability to process a lot of information, structured or not, efficiently; you can also monitor and learn behaviors quickly, ensuring a fast response time.

Intelligent systems can take advantage of existing sources of threat intelligence, available information on vulnerabilities, device event logs, and contextual data which allow obtaining proactive and systematic security information, based on a multiplicity of sources, which facilitates the detection of patterns that may signify, or lead to, a cyberattack.

In short, by feeding on multiple contexts and varied sources, the ability of AI to detect patterns is enhanced and thus, both the information it can provide and the mechanisms of action it can recommend are much more reliable and efficient. <br> </br>

‚úîÔ∏è**Prevention and detection**

Through machine learning algorithms and behavior analysis that can identify patterns, artificial intelligence is able to make predictions based on past events and it is possible to consider infinite data and scenarios to identify probable events to quickly locate parameters where a potential attack can be hidden. Machine learning systems can establish security protocols based on the type of intrusion into the company's systems.


‚úîÔ∏è**Process automation** 

AI allows automating processes with a large volume of information, maintaining a high level of protection, which helps to optimize actions and improve performance.


‚úîÔ∏è**Protect information, assets, and infrastructure**

It allows the identification of vulnerabilities in the company's technological ecosystem, being an advantage when dealing with potentially dangerous unknown behaviors.


‚úîÔ∏è**Optimize human resources**

By automating processes, artificial intelligence makes it possible to dedicate human assets to more complex critical tasks, while the system takes care of those basic and repetitive actions.


‚úîÔ∏è**Deepen the data**

This interpretive capacity generates more intelligence from information analysis, with good data and the application of AI in the identification of patterns and predictions, which allows extracting more complex and valuable information from the data.


‚úîÔ∏è**Steady improvement**

Through these intelligent systems, it is possible to constantly evolve with the use of data, because it uses neural networks with several layers that are used to build more complex and effective interpretive structures. <br> </br>



<title-3 align="centered">  Good cybersecurity practices in relation to AI   </title-3>

Undoubtedly, artificial intelligence is changing and making many of the security protocols more efficient, but it is extremely important to maintain a security position that includes continuous monitoring, user training, management of software updates, and basic controls.

üîí **Pattern Identification**

AI focuses on the patterns that provide information such as network vulnerabilities, anomalies, irregular types of network traffic, unauthorized user logins, and other red flags. Administrators can configure their systems to automatically detect when it occurs, to prevent more traditional attacks, such as malware or phishing.


üîí**User education**

Training users about what not to do is essential. It is as important as putting systems in place for the protection and security of the organization's information. Likewise, it is very important to have a response and recovery plan that staff is aware of.


üîí**Patch holes or vulnerabilities**

Failure to apply software updates or address vulnerabilities opens the door to potential attacks and, if cybercrime uses Artificial Intelligence, these attacks can be much faster and even more pernicious.


üîí**Control verification**

Ensuring that the aforementioned practices are implemented and developed for patching and compliance with CIS controls can help agencies strengthen themselves against the most sophisticated AI attacks. <br> </br>


Very soon, the implementation of AI-based solutions will be essential for the cybersecurity of organizations, so knowing its applicability will guarantee a more robust infrastructure for the security of our data.
