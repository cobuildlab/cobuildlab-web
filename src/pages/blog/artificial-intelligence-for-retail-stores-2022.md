The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/digital-transformation-5-trends-to-pay-attention-to-in-2022/"> digital transformation </a> of the retail industry has been underway for years. 

It has increased speed, efficiency, and accuracy in all retail branches, thanks to advanced data and predictive analytics systems that help companies make data-driven business decisions. 

None of these insights would be possible without the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/IoT-in-supply-chain-management/"> Internet of Things </a> (IoT) and, most importantly, artificial intelligence. 

AI in retail has empowered companies with high-level data and insights that are leveraged to improve retail operations and new business opportunities. But you may be wondering how it helps **AI for retail businesses** and contribute to developing these types of companies. Next, we'll show you how. 

<br>

<title-2>Some uses of AI for retail stores</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Cashier free stores:</title-3>

<br>

This type of technology has been a breakthrough in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/retail-industry-a-non-contact-experience-due-to-the-pandemic/"> retail businesses</a>, as it allows for greater security, inventory management, and peace of mind for the consumer. 

Once you leave the store with the products, the IA automatically charges the account to your profile, and you can pay for it days later or charge it to your credit card. This wonder is made possible by AI and Augmented Reality. 

<br>

<title-3>Chatbot-based solutions:</title-3>

<br>

With the introduction of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-chatbots-how-do-they-work-and-how-they-benefit-your-business/"> AI chatbots </a>, it is much more convenient for companies to address customer needs and solve their problems efficiently and transparently. 

AI chatbots provide a higher level of customer service, send notifications about new collections and suggest similar products. 

These bots, which appear on websites and retail stores, can help answer people's questions about a particular product or show customers collections of specific products.

<br>

<title-3>Feedback and prediction:</title-3>

<br>

It helps to understand the customer's prediction based on their past purchases, preferences and sizes and updates them on the recent products offered. That will give them a personalized experience and make the whole user experience automated and efficient. 

The electronic devices installed are likely to inquire about the customer experience once they are done with sales and payments. 

Today, all customer data is noted down to inform them of upcoming offers and sales. It is easier for stores to ask for feedback and calculate customer satisfaction using AI techniques and have ample room for improvement over time.

<br>

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/top-supply-chain-issues-2022/"> Supply chain management </a> and logistics:</title-3>

<br>

In the retail supply chain, AI can be used for stock replenishment, calculating the demand for a particular product taking into account a sales history, location, time, trends, promotions, and other parameters. 

That can help retail stores to be able to have all products stacked ready for sale in their inventory on time.

Maintaining stock in a retail store becomes vital as this explicitly needs the customer's investment of time to go shopping. 

<br>

<title-3>Virtual trial rooms:Virtual trial rooms:</title-3>

<br>

A new trend and way of shopping in the era of covid gave this AI a significant boost. 

Virtual fitting rooms help customers save time and money on travel expenses. The customer finds perfect outfits with all elements perfectly matched in a couple of minutes from home comfort. 

They work by taking the customers' image in the stores and selecting the clothes to try on, making one have a realistic portrait of the outfit without literally trying it on. This makes the whole process convenient and efficient, without too much hassle in the store. 

<br>

<title-3>Conversational support:</title-3>

<br>

AI-supported conversational assistants use natural language processing to help shoppers effortlessly navigate questions, FAQs, or troubleshooting and redirect to a human expert when necessary, enhancing the customer experience by providing on-demand, always-available support while streamlining staffing.

<br>

<title-3>Facilitates price adjustment:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/artificial-intelligence-development"> AI applications </a> for retail stores could help companies price their products by visualizing the likely outcomes of multiple pricing strategies. 

Systems collect information about other products, promotional activities, sales figures, and additional data to execute this. 

Business managers can present the best offers and, as a result, win new customers and increase sales.

<br>

<title-3>Customized selections:</title-3>

<br>

Many retailers are using AI to help them provide unique and personalized customer experiences and take customer service to the next level. 

Brands that create personalized experiences by integrating advanced digital technologies and proprietary customer data are seeing revenue growth of 6% to 10%, two to three times faster than those that don't.

<br>

<title-3>Merchandising automation:</title-3>

<br>

As more IoT sensors and beacons become part of the retail experience, more data will become available for crucial decision-making. 

With this data, an increasing number of tasks can be automated, ensuring that each customer always receives exemplary promotional efforts and that their related products do not run out of stock.

<br>

<title-3>Fraud detection:</title-3>

<br>

Beacons have enabled retailers to reduce theft since the early 2000s. However, they require the installation of intelligent detectors and additional labor as beacons are added to merchandise. 

However, with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> machine learning </a>, video analysis from store security cameras can help detect odd patterns of behavior that may suggest the likelihood of theft or fraud.

<br>

<title-2>The future of retail is the AI technology</title-2>

<br>

The way retailers research, price, and manage their inventory will increasingly rely on AI, as will the consumer shops. 

Retailers have already begun to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/the-5-greatest-ai-trends-for-2022/"> embrace AI </a> to provide a better customer experience. 

Stores use cameras to understand better dwell and look times and detect shoplifters. But the fact that AI is efficient, accurate, and predictive means it is only a matter of time before intelligent sensor systems on shelves, cashier-less checkouts, and better planograms are adopted on a large scale to improve the experience for the customer and the retailer itself. 

If you are interested in using **Ai for your retail store**, don't hesitate to get in touch with us and take the first step to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> your best business </a> future.
