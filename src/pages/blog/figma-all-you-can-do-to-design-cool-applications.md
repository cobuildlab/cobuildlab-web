Miami, FL. Jul 30, 2022.

Today, designing applications is one of the most demanded professions. Defining, structuring, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   developing web application</a> interfaces is an essential industry for technological development and the adaptation that products and services need to integrate into the digital era. 

We all have daily contact with applications for work, health, home, entertainment, love, leisure, and so on.  

Behind these applications that make our lives easier, make us laugh, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/development-team-is-burned-out/">   make us more productive or healthy</a>, some people do not sleep to develop them; some tools have been created especially for these applications to see the light. 

One of those necessary tools for prototyping an application is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/">   FIGMA</a>, and here we will tell you what it is, how it works, and how you can design great applications thanks to it. <br> </br>

<b><title-3>What is FIGMA?</title-3></b>

Figma is a prototyping tool and vector graphics editor, which, unlike the other instruments, is hosted on the web.

It is a great advantage since it is hosted on the web so that all collaborators can access the project and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/improve-communications-to-increase-team-productivity-by-developing-custom-software/">   facilitate communication</a>. 

Using Figma is a whole experience for developing mobile or web applications. <b>These are some features:</b>

- It is a highly intuitive and easy-to-use tool, so its usability is one of its significant advantages.

- As indicated above, it is a vector graphics editor, which can also be used to layout all digital pieces.

- It supports standard image formats such as .pdf, .png. and .jpg.

- You can add plugins to extend its capabilities.

- Since it is hosted in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/cloud-computing-trends-to-watch-2022/">   cloud</a>, you can easily share progress with other project collaborators. On the other hand, the application also allows you a downloadable version, in case you are one of those who love to have their tools on their pc. 

- It is available for all operating systems if you want to download it. 

- You have access to templates and elements for a more fluid development.

- Figma has a free version that you can try to familiarize yourself with before going pro.

Unlike other programs designed to create applications and web platforms such as Sketch and XD, you do not need to have previous knowledge to use FIGMA since it is a very intuitive and easy-to-use tool. <br> </br>
