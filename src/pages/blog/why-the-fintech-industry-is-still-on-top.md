<title-2>Are there any risks to fintech?</title-2>

* **New companies**

Many companies entering the fintech space have less experience in financial services compared to banks.

* **Less regulation** 

Some fintech products and companies tend to operate outside of the traditional financial landscape and therefore may be pending management or be working in a less regulated space. For example, small business finance providers do not require a credit license to offer business loans. There are still consumer laws to protect you, but it's best to check how a company is regulated and licensed if you have any concerns, or you can even contact ASIC directly.
