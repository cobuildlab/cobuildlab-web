Sometimes, businesses have to shut down for a little while. Since COVID-19, this has been a relatively common experience for companies all over the country. Taking a break, whether it’s to save costs, make risk-reducing design changes, or redesign the business model, often makes the best sense. For example, you might turn to <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/">   Cobuild Lab </a> for help perfecting software that makes your business more social-distancing friendly – a transition that is usually easier to achieve after a full stop. 

However, shutting down comes with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.allbusiness.com/how-to-handle-a-temporary-business-closure-15479957-1.html">   major risks. </a> Customers often don’t understand that a closure is only temporary. Even if they do, they may move on to competitors while you’re out of reach. That’s why it’s so important to have an effective reopening marketing campaign. Here are some tips for how to get the message out that you’re back and better than ever.

<title-2>Can You DIY Your Campaign?</title-2>

Maybe! Many companies already have everything they need (or are only a few steps away from having all the tools) to run a successful marketing campaign <a target="_blank" href="https://www.smartmarketingsquad.com/easy-diy-marketing-campaign-to-achieve-results/">   on their own. </a> For starters, you should have a reliable laptop or similar device. Most of your marketing is likely to happen online, so you’ll need to have a way to access your blogs, ad campaigns, and analytics. If your device is out of date or not running at its best, consider picking up something newer. Cyber Monday sales are a good opportunity to get a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/deals/doorbusters?sort=sortBy&currentResultsLayoutType=grid">   high-quality device </a> at an affordable price point.

In addition to tech to monitor your campaign, ask yourself honestly what level of marketing know-how you have under your belt. You don’t necessarily need to be an SEO wizard, but you should have a solid understanding of how various types of marketing campaigns work. If marketing just isn’t your thing, it’s often best to <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/should-i-hire-a-marketing-agency">   outsource your campaign </a> in order to get the best results.

<title-3>What Should You Focus On?</title-3>

One of the most important parts of a good marketing campaign is <a target="_blank" href="https://perq.com/is-your-messaging-cohesive/">  consistent messaging</a>. Whether you’re running a DIY campaign or working with an agency, your first step should be figuring out exactly what message you want to send your audience. This should be more than just “We’re open!” You should make an effort to emphasize the changes you made during your time away that make you stronger and better on your return.

For example, if you took your time away to make risk-reducing renovations to your physical location, point these changes out! Emphasize the steps you’ve made to ensure employee and customer safety. You can also include references to these changes in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/es/search/coronavirus+business">   your imagery </a> for the campaign – photos of employees wearing masks, for example, send a quick visual signal that you’ve made <a target="_blank" href="https://ohsonline.com/articles/2020/03/05/top-ways-to-protect-your-workplace-from-coronavirus.aspx">  COVID-19-appropriate changes </a>.

<title-3>What Forms of Marketing Are Most Effective?</title-3>

<Br>

Since the pandemic has dramatically increased our digital consumption as a country, there’s no denying that online marketing has the power to make a big impact on a company’s success right now. If you don’t already have a blog or you’re not <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/7-advanced-linkedin-strategies-to-generate-leads-for-b2b-tech-companies/">  active on social media </a>, now is the time to focus on your digital presence. It’s relatively easy to keep these marketing avenues going, and if you neglect them, you’re leaving money on the table.

However, these are not the only marketing tools at your disposal. Calling clients or sending mailers out to potential customers in your area are still effective ways to market. You should also look into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.21stcenturytoys.com/do-traditional-marketing-and-advertising-methods-still-work/">   traditional advertising methods </a> such as radio and magazine ads, especially if your target audience is highly localized. If it’s not, however, these methods are likely to cast a wide, ineffective net. If you’re not sure which is best, this is an area where turning to an experienced marketing team can make a big difference.

With the right marketing campaign, you can effectively reopen your business, gaining back your old customers and, ideally, bringing in even more. Focus on sending a clear, cohesive message, and outsource your marketing if you’re not confident in your own chops. Soon, you’ll be back in the swing of things.
