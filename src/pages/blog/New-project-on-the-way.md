Miami, FL. May 03, 2019 - We are very excited to announce our new project called OKROO. In this opportunity we partner with Craig
Miller. This platform is for all the people out there that loves going out to eat and drink with friends and family, as it will 
give you the ability to discover promotions that are close to you.

Keep in touch with us to know when the app will be out and ready to use, so you can go out and try out for yourself. 

The purpose of Cobuild Lab is to help early stage and new entrepreneurs transform ideas into sustainable and scalable businesses.
