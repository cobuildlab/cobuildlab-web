From transforming people's daily lives and work practices to increasing levels of efficiency and safety, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/robotic-process-automation/"> robotic solutions </a> are influencing every aspect of our world. 

Today, the robotics industry is worth billions. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/robots-AI-and-machine-learning-for-your-SMB/"> Commercial and industrial value of robots </a> will be in the space coming years, thanks to their wide range of applications and varieties. But do we know the types of robots used in today's scenario?  

From careful crop harvesting to automobile assembly to drug delivery, robotic solutions increase productivity, improve safety, and enable greater flexibility in various industries.  Here's a look at the most widely used **robots that are revolutionizing the world today**:

<br>

<title-2>Types of robots most commonly used today</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Autonomous mobile robots:</title-3>

<br>

AMRs move around the world and make near-real-time decisions on the fly. Technologies such as sensors and cameras help them capture information environments. Onboard processing equipment helps them analyze it and make an informed decision, whether it's moving to avoid an approaching worker, choosing the right package, or selecting an appropriate surface to disinfect. These robots are now widely used in order picking and inventory operations.

<br>

AGVs, on the other hand, rely on predefined tracks or routes and usually require operator supervision. 
 
They are typically used to deliver materials and move goods in controlled environments, such as warehouses and factories. In the meat industry, AGVs are a great help in moving pallets, unloading raw material, storing raw material in cold storage, etc. 

<br>

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-powered-robots-for-warehousing/"> For warehouse and logistics: </a></title-3>

<br>

Shipping, handling, and quality control robots are becoming a must-have for most retailers and logistics companies. As we now expect our packages to arrive at breakneck speed, logistics companies employ robots in warehouses and even on the road to help maximize time efficiency. 

Examples of these robots include those that move products from shelf to shelf within the warehouse and last-mile robots that autonomously deliver your package to your doorstep, ensuring that pretty soon you will probably have a face-to-face encounter with a logistics robot.

<br>

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/healthcare-apps-present-and-future/"> In the healthcare industry: </a></title-3>

<br>

Robots have made tremendous strides in the healthcare sector. These mechanical marvels are used in almost every aspect of healthcare, from robot-assisted surgeries to robots that help humans recover from injuries in physical therapy. 

Recently, pharmaceutical companies have employed robots to help accelerate the fight against COVID-19. These robots are used to fill and seal COVID-19 test swabs, and some manufacturers also use them to produce PPE and respirators. They are among the most important in the times we are living.

<br>

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Transport-Tech-moving-people-around-the-world/"> Self-driving vehicles:  </a></title-3>

<br>

These self-driving cars are no longer just imagination. With a combination of data science and robotics, they are taking the world by storm. Automakers are working on the next wave of travel that will allow us to relax and enjoy the ride. Companies like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uber.com/us"> Uber </a> already provide completely safe autonomous cab services.

<br>

<title-3>Telepresence robots:</title-3>

<br>

A telepresence robot is controlled by a computer, tablet, or smartphone that allows those interacting with the robot to see and hear the robot operator. In contrast, the operator can see what the robot is "looking at" and hear sound at the robot's location. 

The advantages of telepresence robots are that they allow surgeons to help their colleagues in other places. Besides, they enable people in business to see the configuration of the shop or warehouse or the assembly line processes; sick children can attend classes and interact with their colleagues, and doctors interact with patients while away from the location.

<br>

<title-3>Cobots:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Cobots-are-changing-the-supply-chain/">  Cobots </a> are designed to function alongside or directly with humans. While most other robots perform their tasks independently or in strictly isolated work areas, cobots can share spaces with workers to help them accomplish more. Theyâ€™re often used to eliminate manual, dangerous, or strenuous tasks from day-to-day workflows.

<br>

<title-3>Humanoids:</title-3>

<br>

Although many mobile humanoid robots may technically fall within the realm of AMRs, the term is used to identify robots that perform human-centric functions and often take human-like forms. 

They use many of the same technological components as AMRs to perceive, plan and act while performing tasks such as providing directions or offering concierge services.

The Global Robotics Market was valued at USD 27.73 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach USD 74.1 billion by 2026, registering a CAGR of 17.45% during 2021-2026. 

So if you are thinking of investing in these technologies or implementing them in your company, this is the right time to do it, as they make our lives easier and safer. If you need help with your project or implementation of these technologies in your company, do not hesitate to call us, and we will certainly help you.
