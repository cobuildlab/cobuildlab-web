Miami, FL. Jul 31, 2022.

If you <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Remote-work-team-productivity-how-to-manage-your-processes/">   work remotely</a>, you’re probably familiar with the stereotype that remote workers are less productive than those who spend their workdays in an office. However, as many leaders of successful virtual teams will tell you, this assumption couldn’t be further from the truth. Remote workers are more productive than if they were cooped up all day in an office, and the data proves it.

This article explains how <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/exercises-to-promote-the-mental-health-of-your-remote-developers-team/">   remote workers can be more productive</a> and how to do it. So let's get those pajamas on and read on. <Br></Br>

<b><title-3>1. Boss on the shoulder</title-3></b>

Although for some, an authority watching what you do is synonymous with improved discipline and productivity, the truth is that when you take that weight off your shoulder, you genuinely plow the road to productivity.

Not autonomy alone promotes productivity, but your planning ability and willpower.

The flexibility of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/what-a-Saas-company-is/">   working from home</a> allows you to combine your private and professional life better, reducing stress and the time required. Which, for you, means more productivity and loyalty. <Br></Br>

<b><title-3>2. Better Work/Life Balance</title-3></b>

Remote workers are happier with their jobs and more likely to quit or miss deliveries for burnout because they can schedule their daily activities at their convenience.

You can’t control how long the day will be, but you can control how you spend it. You must manage your time effectively to finish all the tasks on your to-do list as quickly as possible while avoiding getting stressed out or frustrated. <Br></Br>

<b><title-3>3. Working at Home</title-3></b>

A person's comfort zone significantly influences <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/top-pros-of-remote-software-developer-service/">   remote workers' productivity.</a> 

The comfort of your home or any safe area you choose as your workplace will give you much more security to fulfill your assigned tasks, freeing you from the pressure that can cause a rigid office environment. <Br></Br>

<b><title-3>4. Unlimited breaks</title-3></b>

Working with deadlines and time management can be beneficial but also a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/development-team-is-burned-out/">   double-edged sword.</a>

Breaks are unlimited; of course, they are necessary to regain strength and take advantage of remote work, but the longer the break, the less time to complete tasks. 

The ideal is to organize work and leisure time to not consume either with the other. The Pomodoro method is an excellent option to manage your time and be even more productive. <Br></Br>

<b><title-3>5. Flexibility</title-3></b>

Regardless of how much you can twist your body, the simple idea of being able to control your time in your favor increases self-discipline and willingness to work.

Morning, afternoon, and evening become just names and do not represent limitations to your work. <Br></Br>

<title-2 align="centered">At home is better as long as you plan it to be</title-2>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/hire-remote-software-developers/">   Remote workers</a> have long been associated with being less productive than those working in an office daily. It has been found that remote workers are more effective than in-office employees because they are not distracted by their surroundings and can focus on their work without interruption.

The essential point is to maintain an excellent virtual culture when deciding to work from home, either as a freelancer or as a team member. Communication will always be the key to the perfect development of the team or activities.
