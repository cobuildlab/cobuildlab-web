Cobuild Lab team is happy to welcome  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anibaloz/"> Luis Anibal Olivares</a> to the team. As an entry-level software developer, Luis will be responsible for assisting our development team with all aspects of software design and coding, to learn as much as possible. Luis enjoys learning and expanding his knowledge in web development so he signs up for every Plazi class he can get his hands on, improving his skills in React and Typescript. 

As part of his role, Luis will be learning the codebase of the assigned project, writing basic code, and fixing any bug that could show up. He will also be attending design meetings as part of his training and assisting the team in all front-end related tasks. 

Luis will also be in charge of gathering as much information as possible from users about the software product functionality, monitoring the technical performance, and writing reports about his findings.   <br> </br>


For us at Cobuild Lab, working in Tech means working in the future, from the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/internet-of-things-promises-2019/amp/"> Internet of Things</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/blockchain-world/amp/"> Blockchain</a> every man and woman in the industry is a visionary and passionate creator how to think outside the box, and quoting Apple’s founder Steve Jobs “people who are crazy enough to believe they can change the world, are the ones who do”. Let’s wish Luis Anibal the best and thank you so much for reading! <br> </br>
