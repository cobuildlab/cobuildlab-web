<br>

<title-3>* Simplifies Tasks(Automation)</title-3>

<br>

Workload reduction is a fact thanks to AI, because your employees can dedicate themselves to other kinds of tasks or activities that require a little more attention, while AI is used for routine and repetitive tasks and activities, in this way we are more accurate and decrease the possibility of human error. Removing friction from service workflows makes field service management easier, as well as more successful.

<title-3>* Improved customer service(Chat Bots)</title-3>

<br>

Today, Ai can provide a solution to consumer communication problems that existed years ago. Intelligence software linked to chatbots can learn the right answers for each customer question, automating a significant majority of chat interactions. Typically, AI alone can handle 50% to 60% of requests, but if an AI chatbot cannot answer a question, a human agent can take over the conversation thread without missing a beat. 

<br>

<title-3>* Data Analysis (Machine Learning)</title-3>

<br>

The field services industry involves a lot of data. A few years ago, organizations relied on human intelligence to analyze big data. The problem is that there were human errors in this data analysis that made the data less reliable. However, with Artificial Intelligence data analysis, 100% accuracy in data analysis can be achieved  through sophisticated data analysis tools that allow deciphering massive data and providing accurate solutions.

Streamlining project planning, staffing needs, new products, inventory management, and customer service with analytics, IoT (Internet of Things) and Big Data have found their place in the field service industry. And they allow a lot of information to be collected from sensors and machines. AI uses these information sets to enable service companies to make informed decisions.

<br>

<title-3>* Promotes Mobility</title-3>

<br>

AI-driven mobility has a huge impact on service workflows, and is a huge benefit for field service organizations. These advantages do not go unnoticed, and the adoption of virtual services is, in fact, one of the top trends in field services this 2021, and is expected to continue to grow in importance.  It allows better coordination between back-end staff and field agents to continue to play a vital role in helping companies execute tasks smoothly.  

<br>

<title-3>* Increasing Productivity</title-3>

<br>

All of the above developments will lead to increased productivity levels as processes are streamlined and efficiency is maximized.AI-based route optimization also reduces time lost in transit. In addition, intelligent parts and inventory management helps technicians make informed decisions about all the tools needed for that day's jobs, reducing redundant stops to pick up parts and tools. All of this minimizes unnecessary repetition in the service workflow and allows technicians to focus on serving as many customers as possible, increasing service productivity.
