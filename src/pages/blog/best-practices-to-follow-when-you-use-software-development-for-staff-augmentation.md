<br>

You must understand that communicating the objectives and values of the company to your employees, whether they are permanent or contract workers, allows them to understand a little more about what they are doing there, and why they are doing it.

<br>

Communication between the development team and you is one of the most important factors when developing an application or software. At the beginning of any project, the means of communication must be established, to avoid misunderstandings in the end. Using successful communication it is possible to raise each one of the phases of the project, objectives, it is possible to foment the collaboration and even the transfer of information between the developers and you.

<br>

In a development project, flexibility is a very important aspect to ensure that all objectives are achieved. When you increase the staff for this type of development, these people usually have a wide experience and trajectory in application and software development, so you must allow them to express their disagreements, ideas, and possible improvements, the more they contribute to the project, the more efficient it will be. This is why developments that are a little more flexible tend to be much more successful.

<br>

<title-2>4. Determine work roles</title-2>

<br>

By defining the work roles you are taking a big step towards the success of your project. The roles in a development project should be defined from the start so that everyone knows what they have to do. This distribution of roles should be equitable in terms of workloads and according to the capacity of each one. Clearly defined roles also provide developers with a point of contact to share ideas and provide feedback.  

All staff should know the individual steps of the project, including when meetings are scheduled, what tasks have been assigned and to whom.  

<br>

<title-2>5. Implement management tools and technology</title-2>

<br>

By implementing management tools and technology, we can ensure that we will have a very orderly project, focused on the fulfillment of each of the stages, ensure the respect of budget limits, respect the schedule, comply with the scope, adhere to quality standards, and achieve the expected benefits. It has been proven that the use of these tools facilitates the work of developers, allowing them to focus more on the design and structure of the development.

Documenting the development code is of utmost importance for the total success of the project. All companies should ensure that developers keep a record of the code at each stage of development.
