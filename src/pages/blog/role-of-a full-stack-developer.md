A full-stack developer is a professional in front-end and back-end development.

At the beginning of a project, full-stack developers may meet with members of the software development team to establish the scale and scope of the software project. Then, they will begin designing and building the software. Developers write high-level and low-level code. They fix bugs, help create the user experience, resolve bugs, and improve the overall efficiency of the software. 

Full-stack developers need excellent collaboration skills because they work with front-end and back-end development team members.

<title-2>When is a full-stack developer needed?</title-2>

<br>

It depends on the size and scalability of the software. For example, a small indie game group of a few people creating a small simulator might have a back-end developer and a front-end developer; that might be all they need for development. If they are even smaller, they could have a full-stack developer who handles the entire application. On the other hand, an extensive web application with solid scaling potential will require many hands on deck - Back-End, Front-end, and Full-Stack Developers.
