Miami, FL. Feb 18, 2028.

Digital and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/trends-forwarding-tech/">   technological innovations</a> have covered the topic of mobile devices, wellness, health, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   automation, or artificial intelligence</a>, and the financial sector has significantly been involved in the evolution suggested by these advances. 

Banks and other organizations that have to do with finance, or simply any company that has accountants or administrators, are sure to have adopted to a greater or lesser extent the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/technology-brands-and-blockchain/">   financial technologies</a> that currently rule the world. 

Managing cash is a thing of the past. Modern advances have drastically changed how people relate their finances, whether personal or corporate, in the last five years.

This article will talk about the challenges that companies must undertake in terms of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/blockchain-world/">   financial technology or Fintech</a>, as it is also known. But we cannot speak about these technologies without first defining them properly.

<title-2 align="centered">Finance + Technology = FINTECH</title-2 align="centered">

FinTech offers many ways to manage money and this vital object's activities. However, startups that decide to enter the forefront are still concerned about specific challenges with these technologies.

Here are 3 challenges faced by startups that decide to venture into the development of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/what-when-and-why-to-use-blockchain-in-your-business-process/">   financial technology</a>:
  
<b><title-4>1) Data security</title-4></b>

That is one of the main concerns on the internet, be it mobile banking, payment apps or platforms, or any fintech in general. 

For example, banking systems have very rigorous security standards, ranging from cameras to proof testing almost everything to keep you safe, but what happens when all the management is done through the screen? It is normal to feel vulnerable not knowing how we are protected in these transactions, i.e., we don't have a security guard watching our back, or at least we can't see it.

Of course, solutions always exist. For these cases, Fintech has come up with actions that allow users to feel more secure, such as two- or three-step authentication, biometric login, and data encryption. <Br></Br>

<b><title-4>2) Compliance with government regulations</title-4></b>

It's known the financial sector is one of the most regulated by the competent authorities in each locality. If you want to venture into these technologies, there will always be government interference, even if you take advantage of traditional fintech software technologies that do not use blockchain.

The solution is that before creating an application or platform, you should check its legal compliance. A legal consultant may be necessary, but it will come out cheaper than other headaches if it happens to violate any local regulations. <Br></Br>

<b><title-4>3) Retention and user experience</title-4></b>

Within the financial technology sector, retaining users and providing them with a pleasant experience are the main goals since it is essential to create a platform that provides them with security and comfort at the same time. A fintech application must balance these two factors, or users will marginalize it.

For example, offer a mobile banking application that is difficult to breach but not difficult for the user to access. 

The leading solution is to hire UI/UX experts to ensure that the application or platform is secure and easy to use. Also, this is when it is vital to include 2-factor authentication. Some users may be frustrated with having to type in their information repeatedly to log in, and it also provides added security. <Br></Br>
  
<title-2 align="centered">Safety over the design without forgetting it</title-2 align="centered">
  
Financial technology, like any other, must always maintain a balance between structure, design, and functionality. In this particular case, the requirement becomes even more potent because the companies developing these technologies must offer a product that immediately earns the trust of its consumers or users. After all, we are talking about platforms that will manage their finances and, hey! Nobody takes that lightly, right?

In short, an excellent financial platform or application should always comply with these parameters:

- Absolute security
- Compliance with legal regulations
- User-friendly design

In this way, and with effective promotion, users will feel confident to use it and recommend it to other users and create the word of mouth that will grow its reputation. <Br></Br>
