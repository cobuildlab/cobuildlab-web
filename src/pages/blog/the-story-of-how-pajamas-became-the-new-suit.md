Miami, FL. Nov 24, 2022.

Are you one of those who prefer to wear your pajamas at home to work or dress more appropriately for the occasion?

Some studies prove that dressing casually or professionally can increase people's productivity when <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/remote-worker-profile/">   working at home</a>. These numbers speak of confidence and security attributed to clothing. Still, we are not here to talk about fashion, comfort, or which article of clothing makes you more or less productive, but about how pajamas (working from home) have firmly replaced the suit (the office).

2020 marked a before and after for working from home. This is not to say that this modality did not exist back, but it was not as common as it is in almost all work areas today. It was restricted to specific tasks or strategies to reduce costs, such as saving on infrastructure. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/switching-to-remote-work-is-the-new-black/">   The benefits of working from home</a> are adding more and more virtues, becoming not only a modality but the preferred work structure for many, both working staff and companies. <br></br>

<title-2>What are the benefits of working from home?</title-2>

When discussing benefits, we can focus on two perspectives: the personal and the scientific, which is that even though virtues are proven, some can be perceived in one way or another. <br></br>

<title-3>Fewer distractions, more productivity</title-3>

How can we have fewer distractions at home than in the office, even though the office is designed to influence our work positively?

Yes, the office is <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/dont-procrastinate-innovate/">   "designed to make us productive"</a>, but this is not the case in all workplaces. 

When we talk about fewer distractions, it can be very relative because it will depend on your home conditions or the place you choose to work remotely. 

Indeed, having the power to choose your ideal workplace will bring you immeasurable peace of mind that will allow you to be much more productive. <br></br>

<title-3>Too much supervision takes time away from you</title-3>

<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/from-desk-to-dawn-how-the-remote-work-lifestyle-affect-productivity/">   Time, patience, and peace of mind</a>. Indeed, it happens to you: Your boss stops by your workstation and checks how the task or project is going. This harassment disguised as supervision is a significant cause of stress and frustration, leading to mistakes and slowing down the work. 

No one likes to have someone else's breath on their shoulder, much less when we are working. <br></br>

<title-3>Self-planning</title-3>

Being the lord and master of your own time is priceless. 

Even though there may be a schedule of activities and deadlines to deliver tasks, you decide when to do them, finding a healthy balance between your personal and professional life. 

When we go to an office, we arrive home tired at the end of the day to start doing household chores. This only happens when you work from home (of course, if you work from home).

Having the ability to manage your time is worth gold. Many believe that the productive hours are in the morning, but this is adjusted to each person. <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Remote-work-team-productivity-how-to-manage-your-processes/">   Working from home</a> allows you to create the perfect balance between your home and professional duties. In addition, you can take time to do what you love, which becomes a healthy and productive routine. <br></br>

At this point, no matter if you decide to wear your pajamas or the most formal suit you own, working from home has become a lifestyle rather than just an option.
