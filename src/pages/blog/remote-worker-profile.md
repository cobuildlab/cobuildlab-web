Finding and hiring the right <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/switching-to-remote-work-is-the-new-black/">   remote worker </a> can take time and effort, even for the most seasoned recruiters. Not only must you ensure that the candidate is a good fit for the job role and possess all relevant skills and abilities, but you must also ensure that the potential employee can be effective and thrive in a remote work environment.

Here we show you a little more of the trend marking this way of working in the coming years. In addition, we will show you all the essential qualities that a good **remote worker profile** must have to achieve all your goals, so stay and read the following:

<title-2>How has hiring remote workers grown?</title-2>

<br>

The number of people working remotely increased before the pandemic hit in 2020. Closures around the world accelerated the process, and since then, the employment landscape has changed permanently. Current statistics on telecommuting show that many employers have embraced the benefits of an always-on remote workforce.

Research <a target="_blank" href="https://buffer.com/state-of-remote-work/2021">   shows that 97.6 percent </a> of remote workers would like to work remotely for the rest of their careers for at least some time. This hybrid work style is becoming increasingly popular as we transition from pre-pandemic work cultures. Mixed work allows employees to collaborate meaningfully in person while maintaining remote flexibility for the bulk of their schedule.

A nine-month Stanford University study of 16,000 workers found that <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Remote-work-team-productivity-how-to-manage-your-processes/">   working from home increased company productivity </a> by 13 percent when comparing company profits to previous years. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200519005295/en/">   Prodoscore </a> credited its remote workforce with a 47 percent productivity increase. Many employees, managers, and executives see this improvement in themselves and their peers due to fewer distractions and more autonomy in creating a workable work schedule.

<title-2>What is Remote Work?</title-2>

<br>

Remote work describes a professional environment where employees can work from home or outside their company’s physical office. Often, that involves creating a workspace at home. However, remote working can extend beyond the confines of your living space. 

Remote work is changing everything, from how we approach <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/from-desk-to-dawn-how-the-remote-work-lifestyle-affect-productivity/">   work-life balance </a> to communicating and measuring productivity. The great remote work experiment has reshaped many rules that once dictated the boundaries of our professional lives.

<title-2>What should a remote worker have?</title-2>

<br>

* **Organizing and planning:** When working from home, there are no co-workers to keep you motivated and no bosses to monitor your progress. You must maintain discipline through constant organization, planning, and scheduling to ensure that all work is on time.

 Identify priorities, create a to-do list for all the work ahead of you, and estimate the time needed to complete and execute the tasks. It may take trial and error to figure out how much time is necessary to complete a particular task. After all, things that may take a long time in the office may go faster when working from home, and vice versa.

* **Technical knowledge:** Remote employees use many tools to manage their work and communicate with their team. Instant messaging, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/custom-project-management-system/">   project management software </a>, video conferencing, and document-sharing tools are a few. Remote employees are comfortable accessing the company's <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-using-productivity-tools-in-your-business/">   digital tools </a> daily with little to no assistance. They should feel confident trying out new remote work tools.

Most importantly, remote employees must be reliable, flexible, and prepared in case things go wrong and they have problems using digital tools.

* **Collaborative:** Companies should value an independent worker who does not need a lot of handholding to get the job done. But the trade-off may become efficient and siloed workers who fail to communicate or cooperate. The counterbalance to too much independence is an equally collaborative spirit. 

As remote workers must be independent, they should remain willing to work well with others to achieve the organization's common goal. It means leaving egos at the door, participating in virtual meetings or team exercises, listening to the ideas of others, and occasionally working outside their official job description for the greater good. 

When everyone joins forces, the machine runs more smoothly.

* **Self-motivated:** When sitting at a home office faced with a blank screen and a whole day stretching ahead, there has to be something that gets a person going. With no coworkers – or a boss – around all the time, remote employees must possess an internal drive to be productive and achieve goals, even when no one is there to cheer them on or monitor them. 

An employee needing an authority figure to tell them what to do constantly can become a burden. You want to look for employees with a certain self-awareness of their motivating factors. 

People are motivated by perfectionism, feeling accomplished, external incentives, and avoiding failure.

* **Strong writing skills:** Telecommuting relies heavily on written communication. Employees do not have a co-worker nearby to ask questions or discuss ideas. It's impossible to go to a boss's office for a quick face-to-face conversation. 

From email and texting to Slack to Microsoft Teams chats, many platforms and methods keep team members connected and working moving forward.

Therefore, your remote employees must be able to communicate effectively through writing, which includes proper grammar.

* **Communication:** While instant messaging and video meetings are common and useful for remote teams, most remote employees prefer asynchronous communication, which doesn't require a real-time response and allows everyone to contribute to discussions based on availability.

But that means that when your colleague sees a message you've sent, you may not be available online to clarify any questions they may have. Therefore, remote employees must be clear, concise, and direct when sending messages to team members.

* **Adaptability:** All remote employees should have essential skills to manage the constantly changing work environment.

Remote employees must constantly learn to work with new team members, collaborate with a geographically dispersed team, adapt to new technologies and tools, manage work in case the internet goes down or the laptop stops working, and keep an optimum work-life balance.

* **Teamwork:** Remote employees should be able to work independently and as part of a team. Effective teamwork is key to success in a remote team distributed across different locations. Teamwork essentially includes communication, respectfulness, conflict management, and the ability to listen and understand your team member’s opinions.

Companies can build an ideal collaborative work environment where employees can access the right digital tools to collaborate and communicate. Still, employees can only make the most of those tools when they have the right teamwork skills.


Hiring the right **remote worker profile** has always been the key to business success. Today, the difficulty in finding those people has increased considerably. New channels must use to reach suitable candidates and to assess them properly.  

While this change in the marketplace can be scary, it presents a massive opportunity for recruiting. The world has realized that you can work from anywhere. Candidate location matters less, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/hire-remote-software-developers/">   pool of potential employees </a> is suddenly much more profound.

Take the reins of this new shift in the marketplace and leverage the tools available to take your recruiting to a new level.
