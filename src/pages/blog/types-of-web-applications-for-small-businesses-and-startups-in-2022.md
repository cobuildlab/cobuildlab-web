Every entrepreneur is always looking to expand and grow their business to make a more significant impact in their respective fields, or to increase their sales. With every year comes a new opportunity to leap to greater heights. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/mobile-apps-web-apps-or-cross-platform-what%E2%80%99s-the-best-for-my-small-business/"> Web applications </a> are programs that promote better communication between businesses and their customers. 
 
With the increasing use of the internet, companies are changing their work and adopting more web applications. 

Understanding what a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> web application </a> is can help you realize its importance in our daily lives. This article explains **types of web applications that are crucial for startups in 2022**

<br>

<title-2>Benefits of Web Applications</title-2>

<br>

* **Accessibility across devices for users:**

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/How-can-a-B2B-Software-Company-help-your-business-to-become-a-Saas-Company/"> SaaS applications </a> can be used in most browsers and will work consistently across all operating systems, regardless of the upgrade or version being used. 

The good news is that most desktop software can be converted to a web-based application, meaning it can be used wherever you are, from any mobile device. It allows the user to choose when and where to use the application, encouraging flexible working in companies to increase employee productivity.

* **Increased availability of customer service:**

Access to information and the supply of some products is not subject to conventional business hours. Thus, customers can consult on their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">  mobile application </a>, make reservations, check availability, access promotions, and more. It is possible to have a permanent sales and customer service channel without a dedicated staff. And with extraordinary facilities for the customer, who can choose the ideal time to access the service information.

* **Highly deployable:**

Thanks to manageability and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/mobile-apps-web-apps-or-cross-platform-what%E2%80%99s-the-best-for-my-small-business/"> cross-platform </a> support, deploying web applications in any work environment is more accessible. 

It is ideal when bandwidth is limited and the system and data are remote from the user. 

Therefore, it has enormous implications for extending access, streamlining processes, and improving relationships by furnishing entry to customers, suppliers, and third parties anytime.

* **More convenience:**

Web applications don't need to be downloaded and installed. Or, in the case of PWAs (progressive web apps), downloading and installing process doesn't take up space. 

This reality frees users from the obligation of constant updates. 

* **Higher levels of security**

With a web-based application (with data stored in the cloud), you have peace of mind because if your computer equipment is damaged or stolen, you can get back to normal quickly. 

That is because web applications store the information in remote services. As long as you know the URL (web address), username, and password, you can log in securely on any computer or mobile device connected to the internet. 

Your business can be back up and running in no time.

* **Establishes direct communication with customers through notifications or messaging to send promotions and offers:** 

Your company can reach the customers market interested in your products and services without intermediaries. The company becomes an essential source of indicators to plan promotional and sales actions according to the most frequent requests or concerns.

* **User loyalty:**

Nowadays, mobile devices are essential in people's lives. Web apps can consume on mobiles. That represents an active link between your company and your customers. 

On the other hand, the possibility of customizing web applications according to your customers' preferences makes them part of their daily life, which implies capturing their attention and having your services as a valuable function for them.

<br>

<title-3>Static web apps:</title-3>

<br>

Static web applications directly delivers content to the end user's browser without getting any data from the server. 

Most static web applications are effortless and straightforward to develop over the web. 

They are usually created in HTML and CSS. The first provides the structure, and the latter the style. 

However, sometimes they can show moving objects such as banners, videos, animated GIFs, etc, in some parts of the application. 

Modifying the content of static apps is not easy; the process involves downloading, modifying, and re-uploading the HTML to the server. Only the developer and designer can do this job, but your web will upload faster and weigh less

<br>

<title-3>Dynamic web apps:</title-3>

<br>

This <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/mvp-software-development"> web application </a> generates data in real-time based on the user's request, and the server's response is known as an active web application. 

Dynamic web applications are much more technically complex. They use databases to load information, and these contents are updated every time the user accesses the web app. 

There are many programming languages for developing dynamic web applications; the most common are PHP and ASP languages because they allow excellent content structuring.

<br>

<title-3>Single page apps:</title-3>

<br>

A single-page application runs entirely within a browser and does not require page reloading. 

Single-page web applications are comparatively faster than traditional web applications because the logic of the single-page application is implemented directly in the web browser instead of on the server.

<br>

<title-3>E-commerce web apps:</title-3>

<br>

A web application that helps users electronically buy or sell goods over the internet is called an e-commerce web app. 

Payment integration and transaction integration are essential parts of e-commerce web apps. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/must-have-tech-tools-and-features-for-your-e-commerce-platform/"> E-commerce </a> draws on electronic funds, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/software-trends-for-inventory-management/"> inventory management systems </a>, mobile commerce, the internet market, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/top-supply-chain-issues-2022/">  supply chain management </a>.

<br>

<title-3>Content management system:</title-3>

<br>

It's a software program that helps users manage digital content to improve content production.

A content management system helps create, modify and manage content without technical knowledge. It does not even require coding or knowledge of markup languages.

More companies are adopting web applications to work and satisfy their customers. 

Nowadays, we use one for almost everything, such as online shopping, research, blogging, news, entertainment, etc. 

So if you have your business and haven't made your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> web application </a> yet, you are at a disadvantage with your competitors.
