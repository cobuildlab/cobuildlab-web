Miami, FL. September 07, 2022

Have you ever needed specific expertise or an external workforce to fill an internal need or weakness <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   in developing technology solutions </a>? 

Like you, there are thousands of business leaders in the world. 

For this reason, many contracting models (even remote) have become popular, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/staff-augmentation-vs-project-outsourcing/">   staff augmentation </a>, delivery teams, and dedicated teams. 

Today we will delve into two figures and compare them so you can recognize if this is the modality you need. Continue reading **staff augmentation vs. dedicated teams**.

<br>

<title-2>What is Staff Augmentation?</title-2>

<br>

Using a <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   software development company </a> to supplement or compliment your existing staff is called staff augmentation and is a common subcontracting model today. 

As a virtual extension of your in-house technical staff, outsourced developers are there when you need them. 

The term team augmentation is often used to describe staff augmentation. Through staff augmentation, you borrow a specialized professional from the software vendor to temporarily fill in for a particular skill missing from your current team.

The employee works under a time and material commitment model and is fully committed to your IT project by working as your regular employee, without the time-consuming recruitment and hiring procedure. 

Organizations turn to staff augmentation because of the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the model, which allows them to strengthen the company's agility in response to potential internal and external changes.

<br>

<title-2>What is a dedicated software team?</title-2>

<br>

The dedicated development team model involves outsourcing the entire project to a team assembled especially for your project. It is more suitable for long-term projects, and the vendor's project manager usually oversees it, but this is not always the case, as it depends on your organization's preferences. <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/it-staff-augmentation-the-outsourcing-strategy-your-company-needs/">   Outsourcing </a> a dedicated team means partnering with a small software company and handing the project over to its team of programmers.

This is usually a much broader partnership than just equipment augmentation. It also encompasses various software-related services, including analysis and design, user interface and UI design, quality assurance, project management, and support and maintenance. And, because the vendor's involvement is deep, the desire to achieve the best possible results is proportionally greater compared to the increase in staff. 

All this and a combination of advantages typical of outsourcing make the software company a close and trusted partner rather than just a temporary service provider.

<br>

<title-2>What are the benefits of staff Augmentation?</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Cost-efficiency:</title-3>

<br>

Expanding your <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/it-staff-augmentation-the-outsourcing-strategy-your-company-needs/">   IT staff </a> can reduce the cost of hiring and onboarding new employees, as well as full-time salaries and benefits. As a result, you only pay for the time spent on your project, saving you money both now and in the future. Recruiting and hiring employees is a time-consuming and costly process. 

With staff augmentation, these steps are eliminated. And you also avoid the typical costs associated with retaining an employee, such as paid leave, benefits, bonuses, and training.

<br>

<title-3>* It gives access to a large talent pool:</title-3>

<br>

As your organization is looking to fill a specialized position for a project, you want access to top talent that does not require training. The IT market is notorious for its shortage of IT professionals, so it can be challenging to find a candidate that is a perfect fit for your company. This allows you to search for talent globally, increasing your chances of acquiring the specialist you need.

<br>

<title-3>* Temporary work:</title-3>

<br>

You can outsource teams with the help of IT staff augmentation. 

It implies you can augment your IT team when you need it most and reduce it when it's no longer required. Staff augmentation can be used for a specific project or to enhance your in-house team during workloads. Staff augmentation contracts can terminate more quickly than internal employees can be laid off.

<br>

<title-3>* The administrative process is the vendor's responsibility:</title-3>

<br>

Your outsourcing partner's software company is responsible for the documentation and paperwork of almost all employee-related processes: hiring, employment, accounting, and terminations. 

Your organization is also not responsible for securing any hardware equipment employees need to perform their tasks. Staff augmentation gives you access to highly skilled talent, freeing you from one of the most cumbersome staffing processes.

<br>

<title-3>* Innovation:</title-3>

<br>

According to your location and the contracting company, your cooperation can be called offshoring, nearshoring, and onshoring. The innovation benefit is particularly effective when it comes to offshoring. 

According to this model, you cooperate with a company headquartered in a distant country. The greater the distance between the partners, the more novelty you can bring to the cooperation. This is how increased resources and personnel can become a helpful way to broaden horizons and find inspiration for projects.

<br>

<title-2>Benefits of a dedicated software team</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* A fast-tracked project launch:</title-3>

<br>

It may take time for internal teams to get a project up and running. The project may require additional training, hiring certain professionals, or purchasing specific equipment. On the other hand, project outsourcing involves the entire development process, from the creation of documentation to the release and maintenance of the product.

<br>

<title-3>* Instant access to talent:</title-3>

<br>

When you hire a dedicated software development team to complete your <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/when-and-why-to-hire-a-Project-Manager/">   project </a>, you save yourself the time-consuming task of assembling a section independently. Instead, you get instant access to proven talent and experienced people. 

Plus, the hired team already has experience working together and team skills that take years to develop. Each team member is familiar with their peers' habits and productivity styles, which means streamlined <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/customer-development-process/">   development processes </a> and quality assurance. 

Hiring an in-house team means sourcing and finding talent and assembling a team you just have to hope is compatible with each other and your company culture. Hiring a dedicated software development team means you get all that right away.

<br>

<title-3>* Setting up the technical and managerial aspects:</title-3>

<br>

There is no need to find an additional room to install workstations for new staff or to purchase licensed software or hardware when outsourcing tasks. It is also important to note that IT outsourcing companies oversee staff selection and training. The result is an all-inclusive team at a predetermined price.

<br>

<title-3>* You can choose your level of involvement:</title-3>

<br>

By outsourcing your project to a dedicated <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/steps-to-follow-to-outsource-the-right-software-development-team/">   software development team </a>, you can also set your level of involvement in the development process. If you want to be more active and oversee workflows with a constantly open line of communication, the team will accommodate that. 

However, if you prefer to sit back and be in touch less frequently, the team will have its management structure, so you can also do that. It's an excellent option for people who don't have much time to manage other projects and those who like complete control over processes and development.

<br>

<title-3>* Faster, easier start:</title-3>

<br>

Hiring a dedicated software development team gives you instant access to an already cohesive team of talented and experienced developers and gets your project up and running faster. This saves you time and the money you would have to spend on acquiring those things for your employees and ensuring they are trained on how to use everything.

<br>

<title-3>* There are fewer hazards:</title-3>

<br>

The project results are the responsibility of the IT outsourcing companies, which provide highly competent people who accept the risk. Therefore, they are willing to assume the chances of developing your digital solution.

<br>

<title-2>Staff augmentation or dedicated team: How to choose?</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Staff augmentation</title-3>

<br>

Staff augmentation services are your best choice if:

* You have a side project that requires several specialists experienced with a particular technology or having knowledge valuable for a project.

* Your existing application requires an audit and a handful of new features or testing.

* Your project is small-scale and doesn't require a team dedicated to it. Adding several engineers to your in-house team will help remove current obstacles.

<br>

<title-3>Dedicated Team</title-3>

<br>

A dedicated team will work well if:

* You have a large-scale project requiring talents to handle it within strict deadlines.

* Your current solution requires new features to keep up-to-date. It'll be more efficient to outsource the work to dedicated software developers well-versed in the needed technology than make new hires in-house.

* Budget constraints make <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   dedicated development team </a> services cheaper for you than in-house staffing.

<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   Software development </a> and new technologies are on the rise. For your company to stay competitive in the marketplace, you must develop new projects and look for high-level and experienced personnel. Both options are great alternatives.
