In recent years the software development industry has changed significantly. The days of having to wait months or even years for new software releases are a distant memory, as we now move forward with new features being added in days or weeks thanks to modern agile software development systems, all thanks to low code.  In this article you’ll see why this technology is becoming more and more used, establishing itself as a market trend. 

<br>

<title-2>Benefits of Low-Code</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Decreased Costs:</title-3>

<br>

One of the great advantages of low code software development is that it allows to reduce costs and delivery times, with fewer  programmers and developers needed. Also, since it is easy to use, anyone within the company can learn to use it, making departments more productive and contributing to financial savings.

<br>

<title-3>* Rapid market launch:</title-3>

<br>

This is one of the major benefits, since it reduces development time, and allows it to be launched to the market faster. With the use of low-code platforms, complete enterprise-level applications can be delivered in as little as 2-3 days.

<br>

<title-3>* Less Coding:</title-3>

<br>

Thanks to the Low Code programmers and developers don’t need to implement so much coding and waste too much time on this, because with this modality you only have to drag the functions that are predetermined and paste them into the development, which facilitates the work of programmers, and improves their productivity. It also allows them to focus more on correcting small bugs or on their style since most of the functions are already up to task.

<br>

<title-3>* Increased Productivity:</title-3>

<br>

By employing low-code, teams no longer have to spend an unnecessary amount of time on small tasks, but can focus their attention and efforts on creating the most complex and business-relevant projects. Low-code development allows more applications to be built in less time and is no longer a barrier to software development.

<br>

<title-3>* Better Customer Experience:</title-3>

<br>

Low code enables your users to experience different enterprise-grade omni channel user experiences. This is because low code platforms' pre-built components, automated governance, and quick and easy integrations can make your applications seamless and consistent across a variety of devices.

<br>

<title-3>* Accelerated Innovation:</title-3>

<br>

Thanks to low code, creating and innovating is no longer a difficult task, since it is just a matter of dragging and dropping ready-made components that allow you to quickly create prototypes, as well as complete enterprise-level applications. This technology fosters collaboration between the development team, and their imagination will be more focused on new things and creativity. 

<br>

<title-3>* Scalability:</title-3>

<br>

Changes in today's world are the order of the day, and thanks to the low code software changes and improvements are possible and much easier, even while being able to keep the service online and that none of the original functions are affected by this new modification or improvement. Another great advantage is that low code facilitates custom development.

<title-2>Some tools used in Low-Code development in the Cobuild Lab</title-2>

<br>

These are some of the tools we have used in the development of low code at cobuild lab:

* **Authentication as a Service:**  Auth0, AWS Cognito 
* **Backend as a service / Function as a Service:**  8 base, Google FireBase, AWS Amplify.
* **Infrastructure as a service:** Amazon Web Service, Google Cloud, Digitalocean, Microsoft Azure.
* **Platform as a service:** AWS EC2, AWS Kubernetes, Digitalocean App Code, Heroku.
* **File Management as a Service/ Storage as a Service:** Filrstack, Dropbox, Onedrive. 
* **Voice/ Emails APIs/ SMS:** Twilio, Sendgrid.  

**Low-code platforms** provide tools and frameworks to make applications quickly, creatively, and efficiently. With improvements in the performance and maturity of these platforms, the applications produced are getting better and better. The global low-code development platforms market size is expected to grow by $45.5 billion by 2025, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.1% during the forecast period. The growing need for digitization and the maturity of agile practices is expected to increase its use and reach more and more parts of the world.
