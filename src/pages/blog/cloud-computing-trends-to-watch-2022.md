The impact of cloud computing on industry and end-users is growing, with many aspects of daily life transformed by software running on the cloud networks. 

Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="cobuildlab.com/blog/cloud-computing-for-the-logistics-industry/"> cloud computing </a>, enterprises and startups can optimize costs and increase their offerings without buying and managing all the hardware and software. 

Independent developers can launch globally available online applications and services. And internet users can quickly access software and storage to create, share and store digital media in quantities far beyond the computing capacity of their devices. Next, **cloud computing trends to watch in 2022**.

<br>

<title-2>Some benefits of cloud computing</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Cost Savings:</title-3>

<br>

Once in the cloud, you have easy access to data, saving time and money in getting projects. 

Most <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> cloud computing services </a> are fee-based for those worried about paying for features they don't need or want. That means that if you don't take advantage of what the cloud has to offer, at least you won't have to be dropping money on it. 

The pay-as-you-go system also applies to the data storage space needed to service your stakeholders and customers, which means that you get exactly as much space as you need and are not charged for the area you don't need or use.

<br>

<title-3>Flexibility:</title-3>

<br>

Your company has only limited attention to divide among all your responsibilities. Suppose your current IT solutions force you to devote too much attention to IT and data storage issues. In that case, you won't focus on achieving business goals and satisfying customers.

By implementing cloud services, you can focus on other activities of greater importance and concentrate on business development and growth.

<br>

<title-3>Quality control:</title-3>

<br>

There are a few things as detrimental to the success of a business as poor quality and inconsistent reporting. In a cloud-based system, all documents are stored in one place and in a single format. 

With everyone accessing the same information, you can maintain consistency in data, avoid human error, and have a clear record of any revisions or updates.

<br>

<title-3>Mobility:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/cloud-logistics-software-solution/"> Cloud computing</a> enables mobile access to enterprise data through smartphones and devices, ensuring that no one is left without information. 

You can provide conveniently accessible information to traveling sales staff, freelancers, or remote employees, anytime and from anywhere, with different devices to improve work-life balance through the cloud.

<br>

<title-3>Additional security:</title-3>

<br>

Cloud infrastructure can also offer advanced security options, such as patch management, operating system updates, and pre-hardened virtual machine (VM) images. 

By starting with secure configurations, organizations can leverage the benefits of cloud computing with peace of mind.

* **Serverless functions:**

Serverless computing also helps eliminate the risk of back-end failures and provides secure sandboxes for organizations to deploy their code. Serverless computing within the cloud will play an essential role in creating new user experiences. It promises a legitimate pay-as-you-go model that allows organizations to pay only for the used services. This way, infrastructure can scale invisibly based on an application's needs without significant capital investment.

* **AI in cloud computing:**

Combining <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/artificial-intelligence-development">  AI </a> with cloud services enables organizations to take full advantage of both applications cost-effectively. AI helps the cloud manage data and gain insights, while the cloud provides constant data backup and recovery in a virtual environment. The development and evolution of cloud and AI are intertwined, and this will be increasingly true during 2022.

* **The growth of cloud gaming:**

Cloud gaming also eliminates the need for users to have storage space, any specialized hardware, and all piracy issues, which translates into lower overall cost and sustainability. 

Cloud gaming is an emerging technology that allows users to stream a virtually unlimited choice of games for a fixed monthly fee. It provides gaming on any desktop, laptop, or smartphone without the need for an expensive console. 

While game streaming technology is not yet as powerful as it could be, its transition to the cloud will ensure that the future of cloud gaming is constantly evolving. 

It will also foster a lot where the cloud is the source of the game and the platform of choice for gamers.

* **Hybrid cloud and multi-cloud infrastructure:**

A hybrid cloud solution combines the features and functionality of a third-party, public cloud platform with a private cloud solution. This solution will generally allow workloads to move from public to private clouds and vice versa. It will give users greater flexibility in sharing and accessing data. While there has already been significant adoption of hybrid cloud and multi-cloud strategies as the norm in large organizations, 2022 will see more business leaders and enterprises realize the advantages of these models and adapt them to enjoy elasticity and agility in the cloud. 

* **Open source:**

An open-source cloud service refers to any cloud service created with technology or software that anyone can customize. 

In other words, open-source cloud platforms allow companies to customize their infrastructure based on their needs. 

With an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/software-open-source-vs-proprietary-software/"> open-source</a> technology platform, companies can gain several benefits. Cloud infrastructure can scale much faster, allowing added features more quickly than closed source platforms. There are also fewer security issues. 

* **Edge computing:**

Edge computing is a method of optimizing the network system in the cloud. It performs data processing at the edge of the network, closer to the data source. 

It runs in real-time on cloud servers and processes data that is not too time-bound and stores it for long-term use. 

Edge computing is used for time-sensitive data, while cloud computing processes data that is not time-bound. The edge computing market is currently one of the hottest topics and will expand this year.

* **Disaster recovery and backup:**

Data outages, system failures, and cyber-attacks are essential for managing a digitally integrated enterprise. 

Companies often face server or system crashes that result in the loss of documents or unsaved data. 

Disaster recovery and data backup are vital to cloud computing applications to avoid or minimize these occurrences and ensure that business procedures and infrastructure are not lost. 

A dedicated cloud solution for disaster recovery and backup is a solid contingency plan. The enterprise system automatically maintains electronic or virtual records of documents and stores them on its offsite server in the cloud.
