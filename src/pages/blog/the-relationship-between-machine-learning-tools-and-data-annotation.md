To say we live in exciting times would underscore where we are when it comes to technology. A few years ago, you may have never heard of things like “<a href="https://sigma.ai/data-annotation-platform/" target="_blank">machine learning tools</a>” or “data annotation.” These days, those two terms alone are helping create a world where technology can aid us in answering the big questions.

While the idea behind artificial intelligence can bring up scary thoughts of a world dominated by computers, learning to understand the technology behind AI can also make things less risky. Information is power, and learning the basics can be a critical step forward.

Let’s talk about the relationship between machine learning tools and data annotation and how these two concepts can help us in many different ways.

<title-2>Defining Machine Learning Tools and Data Annotation</title2>

Over the decades, many believed AI was the process of giving sentience to machines. While we have not reached that point with AI, technology has reached a point where AI can predict behaviors.

That’s where machine learning comes in. According to the <a href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2017/12/machine-learning-and-higher-education" target="_blank">Educause Review</a>, machine learning is an AI that helps machines learn about a specific thing without direct programming. The purpose of such a thing, the Review says, is to get helpful information and predictions out of data.

You may not even know it, but you’ve already run into at least one machine learning tool if you’ve recently turned on your favorite streaming platform: recommendation engines. Streaming platforms use this machine learning tool to help you figure out what you might enjoy watching next. Nifty, isn’t it?

Columbia University defines data annotation as sorting and tagging raw data such as text files, images, and videos. Those tags give context and meaning to the data, allowing your machine learning tool to understand it better. That sort of technology primarily aids data annotation.

Going back to our recommendation engine example, say you watched a series of horror movies or television series. If the metadata in those media pieces were labeled correctly as “horror,” then the recommendation engine would take the frequency in which you watch horror content and serve you more horror content.

Other examples of machine learning tools include IBM’s Watson project that trounced Jeopardy! Champion Ken Jennings and DeepBlue defeated chess champion Garry Kasparov, in the late ’90s.

Fun things aside, let’s get into the nitty-gritty on how data annotations help fuel the latest technology behind machine learning tools.

<title-2>Making Sense of Data</title-2>

Data must be handled and sorted correctly for machine learning tools to function.

You’ll need the proper tools to import, handle, and sort the mounds of data in your machine learning tool. There is also the issue of data storage. You can save data on a local drive or in the cloud, where it is accessed anywhere.

As we learned earlier from Columbia University, data annotation can be encompassed by images, text, and videos that can be recognized by your machine learning tool.

Your imagery, in particular, can be drilled down even further to image annotation types like polygon annotation, 3D point cloud annotation, and bounding box annotation, just to name a few.

Once you’ve picked out your toolset, how you’ll handle and sort your data, and what type of data you’ll be using, you’ll need to develop a quality control system that can ensure your information is clean and consistent.

You might even employ automation through a script or a macro to help in this area. Automation like this, according to <a href="https://old.dataone.org/best-practices/develop-quality-assurance-and-quality-control-plan" target="_blank">DataOne</a>, can create an error-checking and review system that can be repeated.

You didn’t think you’d be going through all this data without some sort of human element, did you? Well, another part of this delicate process is workforce management. Manpower is always necessary to ensure the data annotation process is running smoothly. Many tech companies often outsource this level of work to save money.

Finally, the issue of securing the data becomes important – especially if you’re outsourcing the data annotation work. Get with your IT team to discuss everything from storage to encryption, especially if some of the sensitive data you’re working with.

<title-2>Taking Your Data to the Next Level</title-2>

Once you have your data annotation systems in place, it’s time to find the right tool to use this data to your advantage.

There are many different options out there for machine learning tools. Luckily, most of your major software companies like Amazon and Microsoft have systems you can use like Azure and Amazon Machine Learning.

Picking out your software largely depends on what type of use you’re hoping to get out of it.

Machine learning with different data types can be used on various applications such as making predictions, financial forecasting, and even speech and image recognition.

On the financial forecasting front, the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/finance/financial-markets/Artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-big-data-in-finance.pdf" target="_blank">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development</a> believes machine learning tools bring enhanced benefits through efficiency and better financial services. They caution that some machine learning can introduce risks to the financial markets.

The <a href="https://sma.org/ai-in-medical-diagnosis/" target="_blank">Southern Medical Association</a> detailed a study from a global technology firm that attempted to use machine learning in diagnosing diseases. Their model had an average diagnostic accuracy rating of 77.26 percent. Doctors who tested alongside the machine learning tool had a moderate diagnostic accuracy rating of 71.40 percent. The study indicates that a machine learning tool dedicated to solving medical diagnosis issues can be helpful. Eat your heart out, Dr. Gregory House.

<title-2>Conclusion</title-2>

Whatever your reasons for creating a machine learning tool, the delicate relationship between data annotation and that tool is one-way technology creates efficiencies for simple data-based processes. It's important to understand that while the power wielded by machine learning can be terrifying, a robust data annotation system can calm some of the concerns and open up a new world of possibilities.
