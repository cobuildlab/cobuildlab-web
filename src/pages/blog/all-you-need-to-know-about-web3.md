Miami, FL. Jun 25, 2022

Centralization has helped bring billions of people to the World Wide Web and has created the stable and robust infrastructure upon which it lives. 

At the same time, a handful of centralized entities have a stranglehold on large swaths of the World Wide Web, unilaterally deciding what should and should not be allowed. This generated unconformity in some people, so the web 3 emerged as the answer to this dilemma.

Instead of a monopolized web, Web3 embraces decentralization, built, operated, and owned by users.

Most <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/blockchain-world/">   blockchain </a>/crypto users are enthusiastic about the Web3 and believe it will change the Internet as we know it. On the other hand, many of the world's population still do not understand how cryptocurrencies and blockchain work, hence their confusion and skepticism about Web3. 

Below we introduce **all you need to know about Web 3**, even how important it will be in the future.

<br>

<title-2>What is web 3?</title-2>

<br>

Web3 is a new generation of the Internet that runs on public blockchains. Blockchain is a technology that spans a network of nodes. 

Blockchain's leading superpower is enabling decentralization, that is, the deconcentration of power in data networks. Because of this feature, the central idea and promise of Web3 are that it will make the Internet decentralized.

That means that users can own parts of the Internet without the need for centralized authorities to allow access, govern and hold user data or demand fees for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   premium services. </a>

Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood coined the premise of Web 3 shortly after Ethereum's launch in 2014. Gavin put into words a solution to a problem that many early cryptocurrency adopters felt: the Web required too much trust. 

Most of the Web people know and use today relies on trust in a handful of private companies to act in the public's best interest.

<title-2>What can you do on the web 3?</title-2>

<br>

The blockchain-enabled Web3 changes the way we interact with the Internet. Users experience authentic peer-to-peer connections as Web3 distributes data among all participating nodes. This mechanism makes it more difficult to hack an application and censor content. Second, transactions are on-chain, making Web3 networks more transparent.

Web3 does this with the help of smart contracts and computer protocols that store, verify and enforce the terms of established agreements without the need for third parties. 

An excellent example of Web3 protocols that use intelligent contracts is decentralized applications. Web 3 can provide users with much greater utility, going far beyond the social networking, streaming, and online shopping that make up the majority of Web 2.0 applications used by consumers.

Capabilities such as the semantic web, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-and-machine-learning-trends-to-watch-in-2022/">   AI </a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   machine learning </a>, which are at the core of Web 3.0, can vastly increase application in new areas and greatly enhance user interaction.

<br>

<title-2>Criticisms of Web 3</title-2>

<br>

The main criticism of Web 3 technology is that it does not live up to its ideals. Ownership of blockchain networks is not evenly distributed but is concentrated in the hands of early adopters and venture capitalists. 

At the criticism’s heart is the idea of the theater of decentralization, where blockchain projects are decentralized in name but not in substance. 

Private blockchains, venture-backed investments, or decentralized funding protocols (Defi), where only a few people hold the keys to hundreds of millions of dollars, are examples of decentralization theater.

Critics are not only targeting Web3 but also attacking the building blocks of the technology. Thus, the Financial Times calls cryptocurrencies a Ponzi scheme, CNET says NFTs are nonsense, or The Verge calls blockchains "nonsense."

I could dig for more links, but you get the idea—Web3 is gaining steam, and many people don't like it. 

Some of these people have good reasons for criticizing Web3. The technology is relatively new, with many kinks to work out, yet evangelists describe it as the most significant technological revolution since the arrival of the Internet.

<title-2>Importance of the web3</title-2>

<br>

The Internet has changed the world for the better in many ways. The Semantic Web is the next step in the evolution of the Internet, and it will ensure that we can always take advantage of its benefits and avoid its frustrations. 

Web 3.0 is essential because it allows businesses to streamline operations by cutting out the middleman and directly connecting computers. It facilitates communication and collaboration between employees, partners, and customers, making for a more efficient business.

We believe there are five compelling reasons why Web 3 is significant, which are as follows:

* Easy access to information
* Data Security and Control
* Permissionless blockchain
* Seamless services
* Single Profile Creation

Web 3 is already being implemented with blockchains like Ethereum. But despite its recent popularity, it is still a work in progress. 

The evolution of the Web 3 phenomenon is highly dependent on blockchain adoption. 

It could increase once users worldwide become aware of the need for trust on the web and start demanding it themselves.
