The vast majority of companies need some kind of **IT support**, and a good portion of them consider IT to be critical to the day-to-day running of their business. Today only do you have to think about your company's overall IT requirements, but also about the particular needs of each of your company's departments , such as customized programs, software, or workflows. When it comes to having internal or outsourced IT support,  it can be a daunting task to choose which of the two to go for, but don't worry, we have some tips that will help you a great deal: 

<br>

<title-2>* Advantages of internal IT support</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Better control of your data:</title-3>

<br>

Companies are usually worried about who can see or get their data, since many times, it contains private information of clients or company secrets that can be made public. This is why sometimes companies decide to go this route. Keeping your data in-house adds an element of confidence in your control over it.  

Although this advantage could be incorporated into the outsourced IT support service, using robust and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/cybersecurity/"> cyber-secure </a> data storage technologies such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/blockchain-world/">  blockchain </a>. 

<br>

<title-3>There is greater intimacy among the team and general knowledge of the business:</title-3>

<br>

Many companies have quirks or idiosyncrasies in their business processes. Sometimes they are a hindrance to the company, often they are simply choices between similar options. An in-house team can familiarize themselves with the company, the product, and all the details involved, as well as get a deeper understanding (generally) of the market and no doubt your IT team knows how it all works. 

<br>

<title-3>Quick solution to technical problems:</title-3>

<br>

An in-house IT support team can answer and resolve many issues or technical problems very quickly. Larger companies may even be able to employ staff on night-time and irregular hour shifts, to enable even better coverage in the event of system failures.

<br>

<br>

As you will see below, this type of support is currently more sought after and advantageous for most companies, and we will show you why: 

<br>

<title-3>Lower costs:</title-3>

<br>

This modality helps you save money for your company since you only pay a monthly fee for the support and they just start and the company that provides the service takes care of the maintenance and each one of the updates, unlike an internal IT where  if you must invest in infrastructure, personnel, and training, all these activities are usually more expensive.

<br>

<title-3>Easy scalability and growth:</title-3>

<br>

Externally, the scalability and growth of your IT support are much easier, since in many cases with just one call you can solve it without wasting so much time and money. Costs and service go hand in hand, of course, but you will never get to that place where your needs exceed your staff to an uncomfortable degree. Likewise, you will never reach a point where your service is far more than your needs, as it can shrink as quickly as it grows.

<br>

<title-3>Access to various types of tools:</title-3>

<br>

Usually, the hiring of these services brings with them several types of tools and services that are industrial and business class, which are usually very expensive to hire separately, this way you make it more profitable for the company and have several features in a single service.

<br>

<title-3>You should not train IT staff:</title-3>

<br>

Another great advantage of having this modality in your company is that you don't have to waste money or time training your personnel to install, set up, and maintain your IT support network, this way, your personnel can focus on other activities that are centered on productivity, efficiency and product quality.  

<br>

<title-3>24-hour support:</title-3>

<br>

With outsourced IT support, you'll have 24/7/365 support, so you don't have to worry about things like sickness or vacation coverage. Sometimes service providers set up hotlines with their customers to expedite the support process and solve problems faster. Today, many problems can be resolved remotely, so you may not need a full-time team on-site at all times.

Your company needs IT support to keep up to date and to be able to offer a better quality service keeping your customer's satisfaction and loyalty, so start today to invest in your IT support and don't worry anymore. Let others do it for you!
