Miami, FL. Feb 04, 2022

The pandemic has hit many industries very hard. Most of these did not expect such demanding circumstances to meet their objectives: reach their customers and meet the demands they commonly had.

Major retailers like Walmart, Macy's, and Apple are just a few examples of retailers that have reduced store hours and even temporarily closed their locations due to the rising tide of COVID-19 cases and infections.

The <B>retail</B> industry has had to rethink the in-store <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/customer-development-process/">   customer experience</a> on the go, adjusting scheduling strategies and increasingly including self-service options that add value to the shopping journey. 
<br> </br>

<title-2 align="centered">The word "online" before buying will be almost mandatory</title-2> 
<br> </br>

In 2020, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/custom-software-development-facilitates-logistics-for-e-commerce/">   e-commerce</a> sales statistics increased by 32.4%, which increased even more during 2021 by 16.1%. As we can see, online sales are on the rise, a trend that does not seem to stop anytime soon but instead will seek to take over all markets.

With fewer store opening hours, shoppers will be even more inclined to spend online. It is pretty obvious, but more than doing it out of obligation, it is an irreversible trend that has earned its place due to the many advantages it presents. This year, another increase in these figures is expected, with e-commerce increasing a further 15.9%.

Today, shoppers know what they want and demand it from retailers. In this case, retailers must give them what they want, when they want it, and in the shortest amount of time. It is about meeting the demanding expectations of the modern shopper, which is nothing more than immediacy and quality in customer service.

Of course, the wave doesn't stop there. The retail industry has diversified to the maximum the options it offers in its different departments, such as various payment methods, attractive online offers, and fast delivery times. Today, everyone wants everything now, retailers know it, shoppers demand it, and the times demand this change. It's about creating the perfect omnichannel experience to ensure the most convenient, in the least amount of time, and with the least amount of hassle.

Suppose retailers want to retain their customers and stand out from the competition. In that case, they will have to adjust their sales systems and take them to the online world where the shopping experience becomes a one-to-one process, quickly tested by the customer and with minimal human contact to avoid contagion.

<title-2 align="centered">Retailers need to sell experiences</title-2> 
<br> </br>

Here are 5 <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   essential technologies to enhance your retail business experience</a>:

<title-4>1. QR codes</title-4>

A very viable option to prevent customers from touching the products and at the same time learn more about them. It is advantageous to keep customers away without socially compromising product education. 
<br> </br>

<title-4>2. NFC Tags</title-4>

NFC tags are used for website and social media redirection, standalone payments, and customizable brand discovery pages.

Additionally, it can be more aesthetically pleasing and flexible than QR codes when personalizing a brand. A success story of this technology is that it can be programmed to redirect to the website at the time of purchase to prompt the buyer to review the product or experience. 
<br> </br>

<title-4>3. Digital receipts</title-4>

These allow you to capture vital customer information such as phone numbers and emails, making it an advantage for growing your customer database. It is innovative and environmentally friendly as it reduces the operational burden of receipt printing.

With customer engagement based on mobile technologies, it is increasingly crucial for stores to adapt to these patterns. Customers demand a seamless shopping experience and don't mind sharing their personal information if necessary, as long as it helps them save even a few seconds on their purchases. 
<br> </br>

<title-4>4. Digital showcases</title-4>

Here we return to QR codes, but this time with the function of directing the customer to the web or social networks to create a dynamic experience where they find interactive, promotional, and easily accessible content. 
<br> </br>

<title-4>5. Local delivery</title-4>

In this case, more than technology, it is a significant part of the service for most buyers, not to mention the importance that falls in these times of pandemic.

Ask, pay, receive, and voila, that's what customers want. Of course, the variant is time. Everyone wants it in record time.

The key is to engage responsible third parties with effective technologies to partner with and facilitate customer access to your products or services.
