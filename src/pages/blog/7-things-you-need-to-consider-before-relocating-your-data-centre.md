Running a business can be a difficult venture. Not only do you have to manage your resources efficiently, but you'll also have to be ready to make tough decisions when the situation calls for it.

One of those big decisions may involve relocating your data centre. With data servers housing confidential information, customer data, and a tonne of valuable company resources, the stakes can be high.

Furthermore, the cost of relocating isn't cheap. But if you want to keep your customer satisfied and your business running smoothly, investing in a better data centre is a must.

Before you decide to move your data centre, make sure to consider these seven things to ensure your business's successful transition.

<br>

<title-2>1) Align Your Employees With The Move</title-2>

Before signing any contract, keep your staff in the loop of the significance and timeline of the data centre relocation. The company's hardware engineers, IT personnel, network engineers, and other relevant departments should all be adequately and promptly informed about the relocation so that they can fulfil their personal obligations.

It's also important to be receptive to any feedback and concerns your employees might have regarding the move. While keeping the flow of operations running smoothly is crucial, knowing the ground situation of your employees may equip you to make better assessments about the move in the long run. In short, communication is essential to a successful relocation.

<br>

<title-2>2) Get a Dedicated Point Person</title-2>

If you're running a large company, relocating to a different data centre may be one of the many tasks on your plate. To keep things organised and running efficiently, consider appointing a dedicated project manager to conduct the relocation process.

You don't have to look externally for a qualified individual; this role could be filled by someone from the IT department who is already familiar with the necessary protocols and procedures for establishing a spot in a data centre.

This appointed individual should be able to handle external vendors, familiarise themselves with the data centre company, and keep track of all the relevant duties in setting up a data centre.

Having a person in charge of the entire process makes it easier to monitor progress and ensure that each task—from the data centre audit to the final wire installation—is being completed efficiently and on time.

<title-2>3) Choose A Scale-Ready Facility</title-2>

Relocation can be a tedious process, but it’s a [necessary upgrade](https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/upgrade-the-software-tool-you-are-using-for-business-activities/) growing businesses have to undergo. By choosing a data centre with ample spacing, good power load, and optimal ventilation, you can avoid any potential problems that may occur when you inevitably bring in more physical servers and wires to scale up your operations.

Moreover, a well-designed facility will be equipped to manage the effects of temperature and humidity, as well as any potential seismic activity.

<br>

<title-2>4) Watch Your Long-Term Financial Health</title-2>

Data centre relocation isn't something to take lightly. If you're relying heavily on fiscal resources to make the move, you must ensure your monthly expenditure isn't adversely affected by the move.

Make sure that the pricing of your new data centre and its services are in line with the company's budget. Going overboard can be detrimental to the [company's bottom line](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottomline.asp), but cutting corners may put you at risk of data security breaches or system malfunctions. So strike a balance.

<br>

<title-2>5) Select an Appropriate Location</title-2>

One of the most crucial aspects of data centre relocation is selecting an appropriate location.

There are a few qualities in a data centre location you have to look out for. These include the following:

- **Proximity to your customers:** You want to choose a data centre that\'s closest to the bulk of your customers to ensure that they\'re getting the fastest speeds.

- **Compliance**: Make sure the data centre you choose complies with all relevant industry standards of the region and the area you\'re serving.

- **Physical proximity to your company**: You also want the new data centre to be close to your company so that transporting personnel and hardware can be done quickly.

By keeping those aforementioned points in mind, you can make sure that the data centre you choose is well-prepared to provide your company with all the services it needs.

<br>

<title-2>6) Label Your Cabling and Equipment</title-2>

Part of the relocation process involves transferring core components between data centres. The bigger the company, the more of this equipment you'll have to transfer.

To make sure that each cable is connected to the appropriate port in its new location, always label and document them before the relocation.

By labelling the wires, you'll help different teams easily identify and access the correct equipment, minimising any unnecessary downtime and system interruptions.

<br>

<title-2>7) Consider the Facility's Performance</title-2>

The performance of your data centre is essential, as this will define the quality of service you\'re providing to customers. Before committing to a new facility, make sure it has optimal performance when it comes to [latency](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/glossary/what-is-latency/) and throughput.

Uptime is another important metric to consider. If a data centre can provide you with nearly 100% uptime, they\'re the ideal choice. Furthermore, make sure that you check the prospecting data centre\'s [SLA](https://www.cio.com/article/274740/outsourcing-sla-definitions-and-solutions.html) to ensure that your company will be adequately compensated in case of issues on their part.
