Miami, FL. Nov 10, 2021.

With the rise of automation, cloud services, and "smart" devices in every place from a home to the manufacturing line, the terms SD-WAN and IoT are now everywhere.<br />

These two terms can function together to improve efficiency, lower costs, and provide insight into any business.

Traditional wide-area networks (WAN) utilized MPLS networks, which continue to have value in security solutions. Still, SD-WAN can also dedicate Internet routes and route packets over MPLS.

However, <a target="_blank" href="https://lightyear.ai/blogs/sd-wan-for-dummies-the-ultimate-2020-buyers-guide">SD-WAN solutions</a> also manage public Internet traffic and utilize broadband connections, providing more options for the control of networks.<br /><br />

<title-3>What does IoT stand for?</title-3>

When people refer to IoT, they are referring to the Internet of Things. Simply put, the Internet of Things includes all devices and physical objects that connect to the Internet.

Many homes contain Internet-connected fridges, thermostats, doorbells, and AI assistants that utilize the Internet for function, which is similar to a manufacturing floor that has wifi-enabled data-sharing from the output monitor on the processing line.

These devices are often interrelated computing devices and machines that can be uniquely identified and that transfer data over a network. If a device needs to communicate with the Internet to work, the odds are high that data is being transferred at some point and that device is part of the IoT. The IoT of a single location makes up the local area network (LAN).<br /><br />

<title-3>What does SD-WAN stand for?</title-3>

SD-WAN stands for Software-Defined Wide Area Networking, which is a jargon term to describe centralized software that manages internet-capable devices or the IoT. The software uses cloud-based controls to push policies to internet-connected devices. This achieves the ability to control and prioritize internet use, program permissions and gather real-time insight into what type of traffic is on the network.

SD-WAN creates enterprise-level connections to multiple locations that allow for easy management of devices from a centralized access point. SD-WAN can connect devices on the manufacturing floor and manage their data traffic, as well as the public internet use on the network.<br /><br />

<title-3>Why use an SD-WAN over traditional WAN methods with your IoT?</title-3>

Traditional WAN environments require time, money, and other resources, and a lot of the work is handled manually by specialists or managed service providers. Each location and all physical materials had to be manually updated or adjusted to ensure that the devices at a single site could connect to a server at another physical location (on public networks, using direct lines, or through satellite).

Point-to-point links, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) solutions manage traditional WANs. Whether someoneâ€™s using IT staff, a contractor, or managed service provider (MSP), changes and updates have to be handled or managed by IT resources. This burden can be greatly reduced with MPLS, as it is a managed solution, so the consistency of connectivity is the burden of the service provider.

MPLS will remain a necessary methodology for any network that is not yet fully cloud-based. Luckily, SD-WAN can work with MPLS and other methods to create an adaptable solution for WAN management.<br /><br />

<title-4>The benefits of SD-WAN</title-4>

There is not a one-size-fits-all SD-WAN methodology, but there are consistent results when correctly using SD-WAN. SD-WAN has several benefits over traditional WAN management:

- **Efficient use of resources.** The simplified network management allows existing staff or a service provider to direct complicated systems and make changes without specialized hardware or travel.
- **Centralized and simplified network management.** SD-WAN management systems are cloud-based, which means one place to access the Internet to manage systems across multiple locations.
- **Easy deployment.** Centralized management means quickly deploying changes to IoT networks on a large scale.
- **Increase in security options for the IoT.** SD-WAN can utilize end-to-end encryption across the entire network and manage other security features like URL filtering and firewall settings. Authentication is required at each network endpoint and on all devices.
- **Less expensive than traditional WAN methods.** An SD-WAN can mimic the security functionalities of traditional MPLS without the added cost.
- **Functions with traditional WAN methods.** Systems that are not yet fully cloud-based may still require an MPLS, which SD-WAN can increase the functionality and control.
- **Network monitoring with real-time visibility, reporting, and insights.** Monitor traffic in real-time and get reports to better adjust data traffic flow for productivity or functionality.

<title-4>Use Cases</title-4>

The appropriate SD-WAN methodology for each enterprise depends on the use case. Common use cases for SD-WAN technology are:

- **Traffic prioritization and application queuing**: prioritizing SaaS and VoIP application data across the WAN for better reliability.
- **Load balancing and ISP aggregation**: traffic monitoring and dynamic routing allow for load balancing and failover response.
- **WAN optimization**: the ability to cache, compress, and make data traffic more efficient.
- **Managed site-to-site VPNs**: WAN connectivity is managed by a service provider, including connection quality and location management.
- **ISP quality and uptime metrics and reporting**: real-time (or near real-time) monitoring of and insight into how SaaS applications, ISPs, and IoT are performing on the network.<br /> <br />

<title-3>SD-WAN Solutions</title-3>

There are three methods of approach when it comes to SD-WAN. The cost not only varies between each methodology but also within each section comes a range of options and companies to investigate. SD-WAN methods include:

- **Appliance**: deploy and manage an SD-WAN appliance at the edge of the network. This appliance manages traffic on the LAN that occurs before the WAN interface and can still be managed remotely.
- **Platform**: adoption of a major cloud-based platform that connects to physical or virtual appliances at the edge of the network and routes traffic through their cloud.
- **Integrated**: utilizing a telco or NSP deployed proprietary platform within their supplied network.

<title-3>SD-WAN and IoT management</title-3>

As more and more things connect to the Internet directly, it becomes vital for a business to manage those devices. Keeping systems within compliance to policy or law, or ensuring that traffic and devices are functioning as designed, can mean the difference between a functional network and one that is down or susceptible to hacking.

The ability to utilize the remote deployment and management of an SD-WAN setup will improve efficiency, effectiveness and help keep supply chains or businesses WAN secure. There may be resistance before implementation, which can be from several things.<br /><br />

<title-3>Wrapping Up</title-3>

Selecting the best solution for WAN management may mean consulting with the staff who will use it and get their support in the rollout.

With any new methodology or system, there may be training required and possible growing pains during changes, but don't let that scare any business away from better solutions.
