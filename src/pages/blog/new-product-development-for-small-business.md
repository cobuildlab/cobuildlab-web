Miami, FL. Dec 16, 2021

Starting a new product can be a very complicated task, requiring a lot of analysis and care. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services"> Companies </a> can invest millions a year to be able to launch new products to the market that are competitive and of high quality so that they can satisfy the needs of the customers. 

If you have an innovative idea, you may be wondering how you can get your company and team to develop this idea and turn it into a product. Well, you've come to the right place. 

Next weâ€™ll show you what is **new product development**, the benefits it gives to your company and the phases you must follow to guarantee its optimal development.

<br>

<title-2>What is new product development?</title-2>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/software-development-for-new-products/"> New product development </a> is the process of introducing a new product to the market. Your company might need to undertake this process due to changes in consumer preferences, increased competition, and technological advances, or to take advantage of a new opportunity. 

New product development is the driving force behind companies and is vital to their organic growth. Insatiable consumer appetite, fierce global competition, changes in consumer behavior, and technology force companies to invest in new products for success or survival.

<br>

<title-2>Benefits of this process for small businesses</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Save Money:</title-3>

<br>

The new product development process is designed to eliminate these risks to your business by testing the potential of your idea and the current market situation. 

Identifying the effectiveness of new products in the new product development process before they go to the market allows you to adapt your idea to market needs or withdraw it all together to save time and money.

<br>

<title-3>* Innovation and Idea Generation:</title-3>

<br>

The new product development process is the promoter and driver of new ideas for your company. Having a framework for testing the feasibility of your new product will naturally lead to its implementation. 

Developing and nurturing a culture of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/innovation-to-your-business/"> innovation </a> is crucial to the business growth of the company and its people.

<br>

<title-3>* Develop an effective business analysis:</title-3>

<br>

The commercial attractiveness of a new product can be formulated once its suitability for the market has been determined. 

This can include cost projections and profit predictions, and how the company's overall objectives will be met with the launch of this new product, which should be compared with those of products launched in the past, either by the company or by competitors.

<br>

<title-3>* Formalizing and strengthening concept development processes:</title-3>

<br>

As in the case of a new company, it is necessary to properly define your product concept early in the life cycle of new product development. This must be done with the intended consumer in mind, and therefore the product must be described in terms that are meaningful to the consumer.

<br>

<title-3>* Concept testing:</title-3>

<br>

Once the idea is developed, it must be tested with market conditions and the <a target="_blank" href=""> target market </a>. The way to do this is to test it with target consumers through market research practices. This would consist of presenting consumers with a physical or symbolic representation of the product. 

Sometimes a description in words or a simple picture is sufficient, but the results will be better if it is an authentic physical representation.  In this way, your company will be able to determine exactly how your ideas fit into the wider consumer market and are able to adapt accordingly.

<br>

<title-3>* You can avoid common pitfalls:</title-3>

<br>

This type of product testing and analysis enables your company to avoid common problems and adverse situations that are endemic to new products. 

Identifying problems early means you can take steps to lessen the impacts of negative influences before they occur. 

Including problems such as failing to meet minimum customer expectations, unforeseen development costs, excessive pricing, ineffective advertising, and market size that is smaller than previously estimated. 

<br>

<title-2>Phases of new product development</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>1. Idea generation:</title-3>

<br>

Many aspiring entrepreneurs get stuck in the first phase: ideation and brainstorming. Often this is because they are waiting for a stroke of genius to reveal the perfect product to sell. 

While building something fundamentally new can be creative, many of the best ideas are the result of iterating on an existing product.  

In this first stage, you should focus on consumer problems, identify their root cause, and with the problem defined look for possible solutions by brainstorming with your team.

<br>

<title-3>2. Idea screening:</title-3>

<br>

This stage of new product development revolves around choosing the idea with the greatest potential for success. Put all available ideas on the table for internal review. That is, use people with industry knowledge and domain expertise for idea selection. 

In the case of a new product development idea, you should prioritize conducting a proof of concept, as it helps to test the feasibility of the idea. There is no point in focusing on an idea that is not technically feasible to build.

<br>

<title-3>3. Concept <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services"> development </a> & <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/software-testing-in-software-development/"> testing </a>:</title-3>

<br>

Before starting the new product development process, priority should be given to building a detailed version of the idea and user stories. This evaluation of the value proposition is the first step toward concept development and testing. 

At the very least, it ensures that problems in the approach are discovered earlier and that the team can course-correct sooner. It helps ensure that technical debt does not accumulate. 

This phase involves quantifying the benefit/pain ratio, conducting a competitive analysis, recruiting key product features, creating a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/my-Startup-Value-Proposition-Why-You-Should-and-How-To-Determine-It-in-Simple-Steps/"> value proposition </a> chart, and conducting a proof of concept.

<br>

<title-3>4. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Business-Model-vs-Business-Strategy-for-a-Software-Company/">  Market strategy/business </a> analysis:</title-3>

<br>

This business analysis will help determine whether or not new product development efforts are worth the financial investment, i.e., whether it will create an ongoing stream of value.  
 
To execute this phase, a cost-based pricing model must be performed and market-focused pricing must be taken into account.

<br>

<title-3>5. Product development:</title-3>

<br>

When the new product development idea is in place, the market strategy is documented and the business analysis is complete, it is time to move forward in the product development cycle. 

In this phase, you should start with a prototype, then move on to have what we all know as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/mvp-software-development"> minimum viable product </a>.

<br>

<title-3>6. Market testing:</title-3>

<br>

This step in new product development aims to reduce the uncertainty surrounding the success of the software product. In other words, this step revolves around testing the feasibility of the new product or its marketing campaign. 

In this testing stage, alpha testing is launched so that engineers can determine its features and evaluate its efficiency and once this stage is passed, a beta version is launched so that consumers can test certain features of your product.

<br>

<title-3>7. Market entry/commercialization:</title-3>

<br>

Favorable results in the development phase precede full-scale production and marketing. Here, the company launches its promotional campaign for the new product. 

Market research conducted during the concept phase influences the timing and location of the product launch.

<br>

New product development consists of converting new and unproven ideas into viable products. This product will be the creation of a company, which will give you a competitive advantage and help you monopolize the market. 

The new product development process can be hugely beneficial to any innovative and forward-thinking company that aims to be effective rather than short-sighted. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services"> Developing a new product development for your business </a>, you can save money, innovate, formalize processes, prove concept, and avoid the usual pitfalls. This puts your company in a strategic position to launch new products in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible.
