Miami, FL. May 02, 2022.

Retail has been defined and reinvented many, many times by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/retail-industry-a-non-contact-experience-due-to-the-pandemic/">   technological advances</a>. In just a few years, what we once considered futuristic is now commonplace and something we use every day, such as scanning a photograph and having it show us information of interest or being able to pay without the need for a person to supervise the purchase. 

They seem pretty familiar and simple things, don't they? But the truth is that a few years ago, some of these technologies were only in our imagination. 

Technological evolution is now defined hand in hand with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/artificial-intelligence-development">   artificial intelligence</a>, ways in which machines can predict behaviors and deliver information according to specific user needs.

Retail will not be left behind with the adoption of this type of technology, right? <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/types-of-retail-software-solutions/">   Artificial intelligence for the retail market</a> is more present than we imagine, transforming the entire process of buying and acquiring products and services, from back-office operations to the final user or customer experience. 

First, for clarity - which many people still have - artificial intelligence refers to a set of technologies that enable automated machine learning and predictive analytics. In this way, information is gathered, processed, and analyzed in bulk to predict, forecast, inform, and assist end-users, particularly the retail market and the people who consume from it. <Br></Br>

<b><title-2 align="centered">How can data analytics help the retail market?</title-2></b> <Br></Br>

By consolidating all customer data across different stores, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-for-retail-stores-2022/">   AI-based</a> analytics can study behavioral and shopping patterns to determine people's preferences and thus reach them through their specific interests. In this way, it is possible to offer added value that contributes to customer loyalty.

Machine learning has also helped the retail market improve its supply chain management practices, increase production and optimize customer service. <Br></Br>

Here are five ways <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-logistics-and-supply-chain-process-of-retail-companies/">   artificial intelligence</a> has changed the retail market:

<b><title-3>1. Making retail employees more productive</title-3></b>

Repetitive and routine tasks are the leading cause of staff not putting their total concentration on what matters.

Thanks to artificial intelligence, some virtual assistants can take care of tedious tasks, while staff can focus on tasks that contribute directly to customer satisfaction and increased production. <Br></Br>

<b><title-3>2. Improving in-store experience</title-3></b>

Due to the pandemic, stores were forced to reduce human contact, so it was necessary to reinvent themselves.

Now, there are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-chatbots-how-do-they-work-and-how-they-benefit-your-business/">   interactive chatbots</a> that can help customers solve their doubts in real-time and automate payment methods.

An efficient way to protect your health in the face of COVID-19 adversity and keep customer satisfaction high. <Br></Br>

<b><title-3>3. Personalization and customer engagement</title-3></b>

We call this intelligent retail shopping, which is about personalizing the customer's shopping journey through product displays tailored to their preferences, loyalty, etc. In this way, prices and discounts can vary from customer to customer according to their commitment to the store and brand.

This work is achieved thanks to the help of AI and NLP algorithms, which can predict customers' particular interests while obtaining their demographic, geographic, and, very importantly, social interaction data. <Br></Br>

<b><title-3>4. Intelligent robots</title-3></b>

Here we mention nothing more and nothing less than the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lowesinnovationlabs.com/projects/lowebot">   LoweBot</a>, a robot that serves as a guide to help customers find what they are looking for. 

Through simple questions, the robot determines what the customer is looking for and guides them to the product, providing relevant information. In addition, the robot has a system that lets it know if the product is in stock or if it needs to be restocked. <Br></Br>

<b><title-3>5. Smart Make-up finder</title-3></b>

Surely you know QR codes; you're going to love Color IQ. This is a technology applied by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sephora.com/">   Sephora</a> stores where you can scan your skin color to see the makeup color that best suits your skin tone.

Artificial intelligence is about improving the user experience in-store and across online platforms. <Br></Br>

This is just a tiny sample of the significant advances that the retail market has witnessed and by which this vital sector of the world economy can keep up in a world so changing, technologically and socially speaking. 

<b>Artificial intelligence for the retail market</b> has changed how people consume products and services, and this cannot be reversed. If you are in the retail market and need help <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   adapting to new technologies</a>, this is the place to start.
