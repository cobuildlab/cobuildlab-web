The mix of hardware, software, and the Internet constitutes what we know as IoT. This technology has revolutionized life as we know it, and especially business development when applied to the supply chain. 

IoT is a revolutionary technology for all major industries: retail, forwarding, finance, healthcare, and energy. It has major potential for processes such as the supply chain, management, forecasting, monitoring applications, helping fleet managers improve operational efficiency, communications, and decision-making. 

Read below to discover all benefits of **IoT in supply chain management**, but first, letâ€™s go over some of the basics.

<br>

<title-2>What is IoT?</title-2>

<br>

The Internet of Things (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Custom-software-Artificial-intelligence-IoT/">  IoT </a>) refers to a network of connected devices, objects, and sensors that collect and communicate information through the web. 

When applied to the global supply chain, IoT technology helps companies to improve customer service while saving money and boosting efficiency. 

The Internet of Things devices can include security cameras, sensors, vehicles, buildings, and even <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Amazon-Echo/b?ie=UTF8&node=9818047011"> Amazon Echo </a> (Alexa). Imagine all of that applied to your supply chain.

<br>

With the emergence of covid-19, many companies have had to reinvent and restructure to keep the business afloat. Always seeking to adapt to new realities and stay in the market. 

Supply chains had to reduce their operating times and increase efficiency as much as possible to meet the significantly increased global demand for products and services. 

Likewise, activities had to be automated to make up for the physical absence of personnel. 

Some trends emerged to solve challenges in logistics and supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as outsourcing to reduce costs, reduce risk, increase flexibility, focus on their core business and respond more quickly to market changes.

Another trend that gained more ground with the covid-19 pandemic was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Supply-chain-synchronization/"> digitization </a>, accelerating automation, and being able to respond quickly to fluctuations in demand, while allowing increased productivity to absorb additional volumes, even with strict social distancing protocols.

Another major trend in the supply chain area that grew rapidly was e-commerce, due to social distancing and circulation restrictions, internet sales made a huge leap up the sales pyramid. 

The purpose of IoT in supply chain management is to know more precisely where the goods are, how they are stored, and when they can be expected/picked up at a certain location. In short, it increases accuracy.

This data can be accessed in real-time thanks to internet connectivity. 

You can also rely on physical tools (hardware) to make the solution more robust and long-term. 

All these reasons made IoT in supply chain management become a trend.

<title-2>The history of IoT in supply chain management</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Supply chain management in the past:</title-3>

<br>

Before the covid-19, the supply chain was not as efficient as it is now. This market experienced unprecedented momentum and growth due to social isolation and alienation. This new reality has given way to the digitization and automation of all processes along the supply chain.

<br>

<title-3>Supply chain management now, thanks to IoT:</title-3>

<br>

* The use of active and passive <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/RFID-for-Warehouse-and-Inventory/">  RFID </a> tags for tracking goods throughout the supply chain.
* The implementation of Bluetooth and NFC technology to facilitate the exchange of information between departments and companies.
* Monitor storage conditions of raw materials and products
* Streamline the problematic movement of goods
* Locate Goods in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Warehouse-and-Inventory-Management/"> warehouse </a>
* Administer goods immediately upon receipt

<br>

<title-3>IoT for the future of supply chain management:</title-3>

<br>

* Significant increase in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/what-is-robotic-engineering-and-how-can-you-use-it-within-your-company/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1633546212518000&usg=AOvVaw0Kz4dQktbdi_04FC_7jAFj">  robots </a> and drones that through IoT can make deliveries to consumers, without human intervention.
* Improving distribution and logistics, monitoring asset maintenance, improving product quality, preventing counterfeit products, and enabling digital marketplaces. 
* The combination of Blockchain and IoT allows for reduced product waste and margins on perishable foods while increasing traceability.
* Improving inventory management and reducing bank fees on letters of credit by combining Blockchain and IoT offer the potential for cost savings.
* Combining IoT's real-time monitoring support with Blockchain's shared distributed ledger strengthens the accuracy and scale of tracking, leading to improvements in supply chains.

An IoT-based platform is a great investment for small and large companies, as long as you have a clear goal of what you need the technology to accomplish for you. 

By adopting these technologies at an early stage, a company can gain a significant advantage over the competition.
