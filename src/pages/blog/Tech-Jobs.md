Miami, FL. November 02, 2022

2022 is near the end; it has been an excellent year for the technological world and much progress. Few tech jobs are in demand, but do you know which ones are the most in need?  

**Tech jobs** are booming. After a slight slowdown in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, companies are hiring for tech positions at a pace never seen before. While overall demand for tech jobs is high and not expected to change, some jobs are more in need than others.

In addition to high demand and comparatively high entry-level salaries, many people need to know that these tech jobs do not require a degree or traditional training. Anyone can be qualified for them simply by attending a boot camp, whether coding, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/cybersecurity-&-artificial-intelligence-how-can-they-benefit-your-business/">   cybersecurity </a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/business-digital-transformation-starts-with-data/">   data science </a>.

Here are some of the most in-demand tech jobs and how they have evolved:

According to the report, hiring in the tech sector is rising, with companies reporting hiring at or above pre-pandemic levels. Of those surveyed, 52% said they planned to add new positions next year, and 80% said turnover has increased at their company in the past year. To persuade new talent and help retain current talent, companies are offering hiring bonuses and cash incentives, upgrading hardware and software, offering perks such as unlimited paid time off, and offering remote or hybrid work arrangements.

Released Aug. 23, the Dice Tech Job Report for the first half of 2022 found that tech job openings for the first five months of the year grew compared to last year, with June representing the first month-over-month decline in tech jobs since September 2022. Dice based its findings on an analysis of 3 million tech job openings from January to June 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.

* **Information Security Engineer:** Among all the growing tech fields, none is growing faster than <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/security-compliance/">   cybersecurity </a>. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the industry will grow 33 percent within the next decade. That is much higher than the national average and higher than every other career on this list.

An information security engineer is a mid-to senior-level cybersecurity position that entails <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/web-development/">   building and designing systems </a> that provide security for a company’s network and software.

Data scientists were primarily expected to collect, organize, and display or present data in the early days. Today’s data scientists do all that and use machine learning to analyze multiple business decisions for companies.

Naturally, this makes it an incredibly beneficial and in-demand position for companies in various industries.

* **Blockchain Engineer:** In this role, you will have a solid foundation in digital Technologies and awareness of safety-protocol stacks. <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/blockchain-revolution-in-business-world/">   Blockchain </a> Engineers specialize in creating and implementing digital solutions for organizations.

While many roles on this list can be considered entry-level, a machine learning engineer bucks that trend as one of the few high-demand senior positions. Few tech pathways can claim so many available jobs so late in a career.

Machine learning engineers will have a thorough knowledge of machine learning and will be able to work within several different data structures and environments.

* **Salesforce Engineer:** A Salesforce engineer will help companies build and improve Salesforce to tailor it to their <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/custom-customer-management-system/">   CRM </a> needs.
