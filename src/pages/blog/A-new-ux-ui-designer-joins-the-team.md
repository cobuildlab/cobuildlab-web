If you don't know it, UX is what makes you feel a brand or product when you interact with it, while UI is a visual layer of colors, textures, shapes, and elements. Behind an incredible product or application, there has to be previous research work and a good strategy that translated into an attractive interface. "What I am most passionate about visual interfaces is creating a design that not only solves a need but is also a design that you can interact with. And the more you use it, the more it envelops all your senses," commented Morales. <br> </br>

*What do you like most about working at Cobuild Lab?* <br> </br>

"The workflow in Cobuild Lab helps you better understand the vision of the client for the project. You are so committed that you know what the client needs, and you focus all your attention in helping him to have the success he is looking for with each design, and somehow along the way, their success becomes yours." He said. "Knowing that you are helping an entrepreneur to take his first steps, makes you feel that you are part of something bigger. Cobuild Lab works as support providing the technology they need to facilitate their processes so they can focus on what they are passionate about knowing that a dedicated team has their back".<br> </br>
