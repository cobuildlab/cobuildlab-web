Miami, FL. Nov 11, 2022.

<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/remote-worker-profile/">   Software development</a> is 100% tied to a computer, so talking about remote work in combination with this career can be the most logical thing to do. 

Remote work has become an option for a lifestyle, but is it still better for the software developer to work from home?

Below, we will detail the pros and cons of a <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/myths-and-realities-about-software-development/">   software developer working remotely</a>, based on the type of profession, the innovation of the work, and the productivity levels and demands. 

Since it is better to do the good things first, let's start with the advantages and the disadvantages (or what some believe to be a disadvantage) and then make a final analysis. <Br></Br>

<b><title-3>Pros of home-based software development</title-3></b>

1. One of the best advantages of <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/switching-to-remote-work-is-the-new-black/">   remote work</a> is the flexibility of your schedule. However, this is only sometimes the case. To have authentic time flexibility, there must be strict planning on the company's part. This way, delivery times can be defined well and according to priorities, allowing you to choose what to work on and when. <Br></Br>

2. Minimum displacement. When you work remotely, two things happen: You work from home or the place that suits you best or allows you to be <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/myths-about-IT-staff-augmentation/">   more productive</a>. In this case, either way, it's your choice, so you save on travel expenses.

Another advantage is that if you use your own equipment, you avoid having to mobilize it to the office and any tragedy, such as theft, fall, etc. <Br></Br>

3. More productivity. This is relative and will depend on each person, but it has been proven that people who work from home do so at a much more productive pace than from an office.

This may vary from person to person. Some feel much more comfortable and committed in work environments, and that is where their productivity increases. However, working from home is better f you like to be in your pajamas and give it your all. <Br></Br>

4. <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/building-a-software-development-team/">   World talent in the palm of your hand</a>. This advantage goes more to managers who hire developers. Your local team is excellent, but there are exceptional people in the world who could be part of your team, and if the only thing standing in the way is geography, it shouldn't be a problem. 

Remote work allows us to reach more talent and, therefore, better performance for our projects. <Br></Br>

5. Multi-cultural innovation. Access to talent worldwide also allows us to open doors to new cultures. This multicultural clash allows for broader creative debate and the generation of new and better ideas to provide more effective technological solutions. <Br></Br>

<b>Now let's go with some cons of working from home if you are a software developer:</b>

1. Nothing like live communication. We have many digital tools to facilitate team communication, but meeting and brainstorming life can never be replaced. <Br></Br>

2. Time zone inconsistencies. If the best candidate lives on the other side of the world, communication may be tricky. However, the solution is to maintain a specific geographic range for hiring or create an effective scheduling program where timings stay on track. <Br></Br>

3. <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/dont-procrastinate-innovate/">   Procrastination</a>. What is extremely sweet. For others, it isn't delightful. Some need work environments to let out all their commitment to the company or project. Otherwise, they can get distracted, pay more attention to other tasks, or fail to allocate personal and work time. <Br></Br>

4. Team organization. Getting the entire team on the same page can be challenging for the leader. Even though there are digital tools to do it, human warmth will always have a special place in our hearts regarding teamwork. <Br></Br>

At first glance, without exhaustive analysis, the pros lean towards individual productivity and the ability to occupy time conveniently. At the same time, the cons focus more on the management side and the challenges that keeping a remote team in sync can entail. <Br></Br>

Remote work is a new lifestyle that goes perfectly hand in hand with <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/being-a-developer-what-to-learn-first/">   software development</a> with a positive view to overcoming any organizational or time constraints.
