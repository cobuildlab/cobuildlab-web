<title-3>The Future of Digital transformation</title-3>

Today the technologies that are part of the digital transformation, play a great role in the business world and in the life of each one of us. With the passing of time, companies have been betting on these technologies, with the simple fact of minimizing their workload and improving their productivity.  

</br>

1. The development of applications will be faster since nowadays, companies need to get their products to market faster to have a quick return. Low-code applications allow for faster delivery with a minimum of hand-coding, fast configuration, and deployment.

2. Another advance in the digital transformation that is expected is face detection, text and hypertext categorization, image classification, and handwriting recognition. This section of supporting vector machines focuses on taking data from any process and classifying it depending on how you need it.
 
3. Another projection for the future is a significant increase of the big data, this given by all the technologies that include the digital transformation, this increase represents a great problem since the amount of data to be stored doubles every six months, and the great variety of data makes it difficult to integrate them. 

4. It will significantly increase the use of technologies such as 5G, machine learning, automation and control, IT, Big Data, Blockchain, Natural Language Processing, AR and VR, AI, and others.  

So you know if you want to transform within your company and keep in the competition of the world market, you must invest without any doubt in the **digital transformation**, so you will improve your productivity gradually. More and more companies are recognizing the importance of digital transformation and the benefits it brings, so don't be left behind and sign up for this global stream of digital evolution.
