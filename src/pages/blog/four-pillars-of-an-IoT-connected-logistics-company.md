**Logistics management** requires monitoring multiple activities at the same time: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Supply-chain-synchronization/"> supply chain </a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-powered-robots-for-warehousing/"> warehousing </a>, etc. There are dozens of factors that can influence the process itself and cause delays. To streamline processes and increase customer satisfaction, logistics managers must embrace the innovations offered by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/IoT-in-supply-chain-management/">  IoT</a>. But you may be wondering what this is all about, and how to implement it in your logistics company, so don't worry, we'll show you how, but before we explain what it is, you should know what the main pillars of a logistics company are:

<br>

<title-2>Main pillars of an IoT-connected logistics company</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Communication System:</title-3>

<br>

The communication system facilitates continuous communication between drivers and managers. 

Normally, the central means of interaction between them are cellphones, which often lack adequate connection quality. It has been proven that with effective communication, companies work better, employees are happier and the possibility of human error is reduced, avoiding a total shutdown of the supply chain and reducing operating costs. 

<br>

<title-3>Location Tracking:</title-3>

<br>

The monitoring of cargo trucks, airplanes, and ships where packages are sent must be monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to provide a better service to the customer, and transmit the assurance that their merchandise or product is on the right track. This is achieved through GPS devices, and helps analytical tools to predict the time of arrival at the destination.

<br>

<title-3>Monitoring of the Supply Chain:</title-3>

<br>

Monitoring each of the processes along the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/IoT-in-supply-chain-management/https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/IoT-in-supply-chain-management/"> supply chain </a> is a great advantage for any company, as it reduces errors, allows you to manage outbound and inbound inventories, and even helps in the procurement of raw materials and shipment of ready-to-use products. Knowing each of these elements is undoubtedly a great advantage in the supply chain world.

<br>

<title-3>Cybersecurity:</title-3>

<br>

The forwarding industry has to cope with some IT security threats, the number of which has recently increased. Hacker attacks on sensitive data can affect not only companies but also external suppliers and end customers. 

Today every company in the world spends millions of dollars a year to avoid being attacked and to fight hackers. 

<br>

<title-2>What is IoT?</title-2>

<br>

The Internet of Things, or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/IoT-is-impacting-Warehouse-Management-and-here-is-How/">  IoT </a>, refers to the billions of physical devices around the world that are now connected to the Internet, all collecting and sharing data. Everything from a pill to an airplane can be connected to the IoT, as it is limitless, and can be adapted to almost anything. Connecting all these objects and adding sensors to them adds a level of digital intelligence to otherwise dumb devices, allowing them to communicate data in real-time without human intervention. The Internet of Things is making the fabric of the world around us smarter and more responsive, merging the digital and physical universes.

<br>

<title-2>IoT applications (areas) in the logistics sector to keep connected your company</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Inventory Tracking:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Warehouse-and-Inventory-Management/"> Warehouse inventory monitoring </a> is one of the most important applications of IoT technology in the logistics industry, as it allows the creation of an intelligent warehouse with the ability to remotely control inventory assets. This allows us to control the status of the goods, locate them in an easier and faster way inside or outside the warehouse, know the fuel level and the failures that are in inventory, and adapt them to the demand.

<br>

<title-3>Demand Forecast:</title-3>

<br>

The application of IoT in logistics can also help keep pace with demand, facilitating effective supply chain management. Smart technologies can predict demand based on a comprehensive analysis of multiple factors, such as user behavior, current market trends, customer intent, and preferences, thus being able to supply market demand and keep customers satisfied.

<br>

<title-3>Fleet Management:</title-3>

<br>

Timely updates on driver health, vehicle status, and traffic conditions provide insight into how to improve fleet management strategies. This technology allows for reduced delivery times and improved routing.

<br>

<title-3>Data analysis:</title-3>

<br>

After the data is captured, it is transferred for reporting, mostly in real-time. In some cases, the data is analyzed automatically and the IoT software delivers the results immediately, such as quickly scanning route maps and calculating the best possible ways to save fuel, among others. 

<br>

<title-3>Environment Sensors:</title-3>

<br>

Special IoT applications are available to help label products and monitor a range of environmental characteristics. Factors such as humidity, light, and temperature, as well as exposure to shock and vibration during forwarding to and from the port, manufacturer, or warehouse. This provides a great advantage in notifying suppliers of damaged products and this information can also be cross-referenced with data analysis to improve loading conditions for future shipments.

<br>

<title-3>IoT and Blockchain for Digital BOL:</title-3>

<br>

IoT applications in the logistics sector, when combined with Blockchain technology, create a digital Bill of Lading (BOL) that creates whole new transparency in supply chains. This BOL allows a company and its customers to track the forwarding cycle of products being shipped.

<br>

<title-3>Autonomous and Self-Driving Cars:</title-3>

<br>

Smart technologies, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Artificial-Intelligence-Do-For-Your-Small-Business/"> artificial intelligence </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/why-machine-learning-applied-to-the-supply-chain-will-save-the-planet/"> machine learning </a>, are blending with connected infrastructures formed by the Internet of Things. The use of these IoT infrastructures in logistics will be the first step for companies to include the concept of autonomous vehicles. Logistics will thus be able to reduce their operating costs, minimize traffic accidents and ensure on-time delivery of cargo depending on traffic conditions.

<br>

<title-3>Drone-Based Delivery:</title-3>

<br>

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones are the new way to deliver packages. Their potential lies in the field of retail, logistics, agriculture, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/custom-software-development-facilitates-logistics-for-e-commerce/"> e-commerce </a>. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/drones-in-logistics/"> Drone </a> applications and the implementation of the Internet of Things in logistics can ensure the execution of automated processes and the fast delivery of goods. 

The Internet of Things provides logistics managers with control and transparency that was impossible to imagine some years ago. 

Thanks to real-time data sharing and device-to-device communication, the technology can provide information to improve decision-making and even help streamline deliveries as an independent actor. 

Ensuring the success of your company depends only on you, so do not wait any longer and start investing in this technology today, to completely change the course of your company.
