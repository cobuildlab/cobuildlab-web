Just like we promised, this is the other way that Google gives us to earn money thanks to the advertisement. Together with Ads, **Google AdSense** forms the network of ads platforms of Google, and here we will see everything we have to know about it. 


<title-2>What is Google AdSense?</title-2>

We can not use something that we do not know. And much less make money out of it. 

Google AdSense is a PPC platform that Google offers us for winning money with each click on the ads you publish on your website, youtube channel, etc.

It is, along with Adwords, one of the first options that Google gave us to monetize with the web. Specifically, it was launched on June 18 of 2003. 

Unlike Adwords, it is not intended for you to appear on search engines, but for you to publish ads from other advertisers and earn money for every click on the ads. This is due to the traffic and authority of your site, although neither feature is necessary to start using it. Even if you are just launching your website, you are likely to use Google Adsense and start monetizing. 

This platform has been chosen by almost 2 million people in the world, so something very good it has to offer.


Also, it is important to know that Google recently launched, specifically last summer, new platforms that provide the service of advertisement, such as [Google Ads](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/tips-to-create-effective-campaigns-in-google-search-engine/), taking the place of Google Adwords, [Google Marketing Platform](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/), and [Google Ad Manager](https://admanager.google.com/home/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuuuXveWE4QIVgWSGCh1GUQWnEAAYASAAEgIIfPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), which we will discuss in future articles.

<title-2>Which are the pros and cons for Google AdSense</title-2>

<title-3>These are the benefits:</title-3>

* **You are free to join**

It is possible to sign up. Create an account for free. That is why is really easy to be part of the big community that uses it and wins money with it. 

* **You can control the aspect of your ads** 

You can just change the look of each ad. The text, the color, the image, and the design, so that it is in harmony with your website. 

If you are who publishes the ads, you can control the categories of the ads you publish and the content.

* **It is responsive**

Adsense is mobile friendly. The ads have a responsive design that allows them to automatically adapt to any screen size making the user have a better experience.

[And considering that more than 60 percent of web traffic in 2018 came from mobiles, this is a huge advantage.](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/social-media-trends-for-2019/)

* **You can make the necessary adjustments thanks to the performance reports and the performance metrics**

The information about your ads will let you know what your visitors see and want most, and thanks to the reports, the metrics and the performance, you will be able to make the adjustments you consider necessary.

You can even access your account and this information through the mobile app. 

* **The requirements for monetizing are easy**

Which means you can start monetizing with your website or blog even your youtube channel when you're just getting started.

* **There are several types of ads**  

And you can have access to each of them, choose them or change them according to your needs, objectives, platforms, and so on.

* Google pays monthly with direct deposit if you reach $100 in revenue with your ads.

<title-3>These are some disadvantages</title-3>

* **You must investigate and follow the rules very well**
 
Because if you break any of them, Google can cancel your account immediately.  This more than a disadvantage is a warning. 

* **If you don't have visitor traffic, you don't make money**

You must work hard, share good content, optimize your site, and do what is necessary to have a high level of visits. This is how you will be able to generate more income.

* **When a visitor clicks on an advertisement on your website or channel they will leave it**

Which is why some consider it a disadvantage. But hey, the less you earn money for it.

<title-2>The kind of ads of Google AdSense</title-2>

Another good thing about AdSense is that it allows you to do several types of ads, among which are:

**1. Ads of texts:** that use words as an ad unit or as a link unit that you can customize in size, text, color, etc. 
**2. Image ads:** which are those static graphic images of different sizes, which can also include customizable texts. 
**3. Video ads:** they are quite interactive. They include features like HTML, Flash, etc. 
**4. Audio ads:** these are less common, but they are possible too. 

<title-2>The most important: tips for making money thanks to Google AdSense</title-2>

This is simple. You follow the next pieces of advice and take the maximum advantage of this tool, and the best, make a lot of money.

1. Read, learn and respect as if your life depended on it the Google's webmaster policies as well as the AdSense program policy. This is the real way to keep your Adsense account in the best possible condition.

2. Offers the highest quality content. This is really how you will earn more money because if you have more visitors, you will have more chances to receive a click on an ad. The best traffic is organic, fight for it. And avoid all those traps of programs to increase clicks or ask others to do it, Google will surely find out and veto you for that. 

3. Optimize your blog articles and all pages of your site. SEO optimization works great for this. Do the same with your Youtube channel or any platform associated with your Adsense account. 

4. Think mobile first. Make sure your website is responsive as well as the ads you publish. This way if a person enters the ad on their mobile, Google will send them the correct size.

5. Try different locations, types, and sizes so you can know and choose the type and location that suits you best to make money. Google's standard sizes are **300×250, 728×90, and 160×600**. Think about that when you get started. 

6. It's always good to have ads in the middle of the content. So visitors interact with the content a little more, especially if the ad is of great interest. 

7. Try your ads on Adsense itself, and get creative. 

8. Keep placement targeting active, so advertisers can also choose and even compete for a particular location on your platform. Of course, this only happens when you've reached traffic maturity. But cheer up, it's possible to do it. 

9. Configure custom channels so you can get a better idea of what's working better for you.

10. Have a lot of luck and a little patience. Results can be obtained quickly, but you need to work for it.
