Miami, FL. Jan 26, 2022

Globalized sourcing, omnichannel demand to disruptive developments, and ever-increasing consumer expectations tend to be a challenge for companies. 

So, they need to be more efficient and have a higher speed in their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> logistics </a> and forwarding operations but may not have the installed technology capacity to address it. 

Today's organizations invest in exciting new <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Transport-Tech-moving-people-around-the-world/"> technologies </a> to address the most pressing issues affecting forwarding and logistics companies. Here are some **transport tech trends** in the logistics and forwarding sector for 2022.

<br>

<title-2>Some forwarding trends in logistics in 2022</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Increased use of the blockchain:</title-3>

<br>

Today, all purchasing, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/what-is-logistics-management-software-and-why-it-will-lead-your-company-to-grow/"> logistics </a>, and shipping operations need a very high level of security. 

These operations must be seen in real-time, allowing better planning and knowing the status of the product or shipment. 

The use of blockchain technology is an excellent option to have the data in one place in synergy with carriers and other suppliers.  

Often, if you buy a product or service from home, there can be a bit of distrust because you do not know who is on the other side, unlike when you buy something face-to-face, and there is trust. 

With <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/blockchain-world/"> blockchain </a> implementation, this uncertainty changes as it allows you to build an environment of trust for users ensuring 100% safety of data, documents, and free transactions.  

<br>

<title-3>* Big data & data analytics:</title-3>

<br>

Data analysis helps improve <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/optimize-your-warehouse-with-technology-and-organization/"> warehouse productivity </a>, performance management, and utilization of logistics resources. Data collected can have weather, fleet schedules, routing, and delivery planning. 

Extensive data market helps optimize supplier pricing, inventory levels and extract <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/software-startup-investor"> risk management reports </a>. Data is the key ingredient to any company's success. 

By 2022, the amount of data analyzed is expected to increase, allowing consumers to have a better shopping experience and companies to know more about their customers.

<br>

<title-3>* More use in robotics:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/what-is-robotic-engineering-and-how-can-you-use-it-within-your-company/"> Robotic solutions </a> based on technological advancement and affordability make a strong entry into logistics. Robots reduce human error, providing higher deliveries and profits. They also enable workforce adaptability and improve worker safety by replacing workers in risky jobs.

Robots are famous in the logistics industry for picking, distribution, and deliveries. 

By 2025, the global robotics market will reach $210 billion, so a massive growth of this technology is expected in the forwarding and logistics sector by 2022.

<br>

<title-3>* Intelligent warehouses:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-powered-robots-for-warehousing/"> Warehouse automation </a> is the process of automating the transfer of inventory in or out of the warehouse to customers with less or no human involvement. 

Today, the mindset of replacing human labor with the latest technology has driven. Companies favor mobile robots, advanced data analytics, and computer vision solutions to reduce human involvement.   

Some advantages of implementing this technology are better customer service, increased data accuracy and efficiency, fewer shipping errors and inventory losses, more warehouse space, and better use of resources. 

<br>

<title-3>* Autonomous vehicles:</title-3>

<br>

It eliminates human errors during driving and ensures the safety of both vehicles and products. AI technology used in autonomous cars optimizes travel routes and reduces traffic jams. Fuel efficiency also improves with platooning techniques. 

Autonomous vehicles are undoubtedly changing this industry entirely and will be one of the cornerstones for 2022.

<br>

<title-3>* Elastic logistics:</title-3>

<br>

Elastic logistics refers to a business model that is flexible and agile enough to scale up or down according to market demands. 

With elastic logistics, companies can manage the supply chain more efficiently during periods of highly fluctuating demand. 

The supply chain can be scaled up or down according to market demand. It helps solve vessel underutilization, storage constraints, and overstocking problems.

<br>

<title-3>* Use of drones:</title-3>

<br>

Drones would use for short-range, light-weight shipments of certain products weighing approximately 3 kg per load. They would help reduce road traffic, reduce accidents, and are more accurate in finding an address.  

Also, they are helpful in this industry to make visual inspections in the warehouse in areas that are difficult to access or dangerous for humans, even being an aid in inventory management. 

<br>

<title-3>* Increased integration of IoT in the industry:</title-3>

<br>

Companies <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/IoT-in-supply-chain-management/">  use IoT</a> to improve the logistics process. It enhances security and theft detection by monitoring warehouse entries and alerts for lost products through end-to-end product tracking. 

Employees gain a higher level of security by detecting problems with machines or equipment before they are used. RFID tags and connected GPS sensors provide complete product visibility improving delivery. 

Managers can quickly analyze the number of items in the warehouse, their temperature, worker efficiency, factors affecting delivery, etc.

<br>

<title-3>* Cloud computing in more logistics processes:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/cloud-computing-for-the-logistics-industry/"> Cloud computing </a> is benefiting many logistics service providers. In the logistics industry, daily interaction between stakeholders is necessary. Cloud computing enables the cost-effective connection of many partners along the supply chain. 

In addition, cloud-based SaaS solutions have the following advantages for logistics: collects data from customers, retailers, and wholesalers to understand the supply and demand gap, reduces the stress and cost of additional software with upgrade capabilities, the initial cost offered is also low, business increases to acquire a broader customer base.

<br>

<title-3>* 5G networks:</title-3>

<br>

The massive deployment of 5G networks will accelerate the exchange of information. Thus, real-time data from the supply chain will be available. 

Devices along the way would alert when a product's inventory reaches a critical level and must be replenished. 

Forwarding logistics trends for the future will focus on the immediacy of information for timely decision-making.
