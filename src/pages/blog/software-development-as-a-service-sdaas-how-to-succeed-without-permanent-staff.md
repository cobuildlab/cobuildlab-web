To talk about Software as a Service Development, we must first talk about the base term: <a target="_blank" href=https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/upgrade-the-software-tool-you-are-using-for-business-activities/>   Software</a> as a Service.

SaaS is one of the fastest-growing technology markets. It is one of the IT services leading the demand, PaaS (Platform as a Service) and Iaas (Infrastructure as a Service).

Today, many companies have their own IT or <a target="_blank" href=https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/10-web-development-trends/>   development</a> teams, ensuring the optimal functioning of all their activities. Still, they may fall short in capacity and knowledge when they want to innovate in web and mobile applications, artificial intelligence, or machine learning models. 

One of the significant advantages of SDaaS is that you pay for what you need, no more and no less. 

Before investing in a platform, it is advisable to test essential functions and evaluate behavior. It is where SDaaS comes into play, providing a team specialized in the specific tasks you need to develop your project. 

For example, you plan to add functionality to a platform or application, and you don't want to hire many people or allocate a large number of resources. SDaaS can save the project because you can employ some people or the necessary people depending on the complexity of the work.

This business model consists of expanding your business unit with a dedicated <a target="_blank" href=https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/why-is-low-code-everything-in-software-development/>   software</a> team, i.e., They are hired to fulfill a project or concrete activities, so their dedication lies 100% in their assignment. 

And, of course, as you are hiring one or several people to take care of certain activities of your project, <a target="_blank" href=https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/tips-to-choose-right-custom-software-development-company-for-your-business/>   the recruiting company</a> takes care of everything, their equipment, infrastructure, support, etc. SDaaS is a way to economize and optimize processes. <br> </br>

<b><title-3>Benefits of working with a remote developer</title-3></b> <br> </br>

<b><title-4>1. Saves resources</title-4></b>

SDaaS is ideal if you need to complete and scale on one or more <a target="_blank" href=https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/customer-development-process>   projects</a>. With a dedicated team of developers, whatever you need at the time, the collaboration model will be efficient and meet deadlines. You save on administrative costs by getting just the equipment you need to complete assignments. This translates into savings of up to 60% in operating costs. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>2. Transparency and scalability</title-4></b>

One of the most attractive advantages is that it does not work like outsourcing. Companies must pay an agreed total, leading to overpayment due to the number of activities or assignments fulfilled. Still, in the case of SDaaS, this is not a problem because you pay just what you need, not full-time but previously defined rates according to each assignment.

A predominant method used by the companies that provide this service is the To-Do-List, where rates are established according to the tasks; for each task performed, the work is paid, which provides greater transparency and confidence to service contractors. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>3. Pay only for the right skills</title-4></b>

There is a wide variety of professionals in software development who are highly prepared to perform their work, but this can sometimes be somewhat counterproductive, as you may be paying for a professional who exceeds the skills you need to complete your project. 

It does not mean that you hire a more or less qualified professional. It is about optimizing everything that can be optimized. It includes the human asset evaluation to determine the necessary capabilities to fulfill the assignments. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>4. Ease of recruitment process</title-4></b>

Searching, interviewing, evaluating, and hiring people can be strenuous. Itâ€™s no longer a problem with a company that provides remote developer services. 

Saving time means saving money. One of the significant advantages of SDaaS is skipping the recruiting step, as that is taken care of by the other company. <br> </br>
