_Miami, FL. July 24, 2022_

The traditional billing system has been active for thousands of years. But while we started using clay or bone for etching IOUs, today’s world has adopted [a much more efficient approach](https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/5-amazing-advances-in-financial-technology-not-to-be-missed/).

Invoices are significant in business communication, from the minor
mom-and-pop ventures to the most prominent conglomerates. However, SMEs
often need the most support when it comes to communicating with clients
in an efficient, sustainable, and modern way.

Without a solid and effective billing system, SMEs will struggle to
retain clients over long periods and may become vulnerable to late or
non-existent payments from those who owe them money.

In 2022, SMEs need to adopt the invoicing trends that others are using.
With these seven trends, businesses can stay relevant in constantly
changing times while asserting themselves in their industry and stopping
late payments in their tracks.

<br>

<title-2>Digital invoice takeover</title-2>

By now, it should be clear that digital invoices are the future. Even
though a fair portion of older businesses still utilize a physical paper
billing system, they miss out on current collaboration opportunities and
stunt their growth.

Adopting a digital invoicing system is much easier than it sounds, and
it can also make your everyday billing tasks much less tedious and
time-consuming.

With a digital system, you can quickly compile accurate, legitimate
invoices and create automatic processes that fill in your details. This
ensures consistency throughout your billing system and prevents a human
error from making avoidable mistakes. Digital invoices are the way to
go.

<br>

<title-3>Automate, automate, automate</title-3>

One of the best parts about this transition from manual to digital
invoices is the option for automation. So many aspects of an invoice can
be automated for increased efficiency and accuracy.

For example, if you have a client who orders from you every month, you
can automate your invoices to create and send them routinely without
human input. Automation takes care of it for you; no more typing out the
same order month after month.

Other elements of an invoice can be automated, such as information
input. You can fill in the blanks using automation if you often send out
invoices containing similar content. That means less time wastage,
reduced likelihood of mistakes, and a more efficient overall system.

<br>

<title-3>Keep it in the cloud.</title-3>

In 2022, many big and small businesses will securely use the cloud to
store their data. And this includes their invoices.

Many predict that [cloud-based technology](https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/integrate-your-business-into-the-cloud/) solutions will become the most popular invoice and data management method moving forward into the 2020s. This is because the cloud is host to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">SaaS</span> invoicing tools and features that further streamline processes and eliminate the risk of human error. [SaaS tools](https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/what-a-Saas-company-is/) allow users to resolve technological obstacles, address payment problems, and work seamlessly with mobile applications.

<br>

<title-3>Invoice systems meet <span style="text-decoration:underline;">blockchain</span> technology.</title-3>

The potential uses for [blockchain technology](https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/how-startups-are-using-blockchain/) are by no means limited to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cryptocurrency</span>.  

This innovative form of technology allows people to optimize their invoicing processes. It removes the need for third-party interactions and enables tracking of all transactional data from anywhere in the world.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Blockchain</span> technology is a breakthrough technology that’s surprisingly accessible to businesses from every scale and industry. Due to its transparent, secure technology format, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">blockchain</span> significantly reduces fraud risk. This can be highly beneficial to companies that are just starting up and need to use a safe, reliable, and private system.

<br>

<title-3>Revival of the QR code</title-3>

The pandemic [brought back the QR code](https://www.redbridgedta.com/market-intelligence/qr-codes/#:~:text=The%20QR%20code%20has%20reemerged,for%20people%20to%20scan%20codes.) for its convenient, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">contactless</span> nature. Now, invoice systems have adopted it for the same reasons.  

An acronym for Quick Recognition, QR codes are swift and easy to use,
making them an excellent addition to your invoices. Clients can pay
immediately without jumping through technological hoops, significantly
increasing the chances of early and on-time payments.

However, QR code technology is not as accessible as cloud technology.
Only a tiny portion of SME businesses will adopt it successfully.
However, at the rate things are going, we could see QR codes a lot more,
so the investment is well worth it.

<br>

<title-3>Personalization is key</title-3>

You've probably heard the word "personalization" come up in marketing
and advertising topics. But the refreshed approach to client
interactions is taking hold in more than one business sector.

It’s well-studied that [consumers love personalization](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying)—it makes them feel more appreciated, connected, and engaged with what they are looking at. Finding ways to incorporate personalization into your invoices is a small change that can make a big difference in how clients respond to your bills.

For example, you can automate your digital invoices always to include
the client's name. This immediately creates a more personal connection.
You could also add the client's logo to the invoice, sending a message
of collaboration rather than a "give me your money" one.

Another popular personalization trend in digital invoices is adding a
positive, appreciative message at the bottom of the invoice. It could
say, "Thank you for your business!" or a piece of similar news that
conveys your appreciation. Anything to amplify the sense of humanity and
engagement works well.

<br>

<title-3>Making invoices a marketing tool</title-3>

Personalization is just one of the invoicing trends that have come to
the fore. Another is using digital invoices as marketing opportunities.
An invoice is a necessary sales document, so you may as well utilize it
to its full potential and encourage future sales.

Creating attractive well-laid-out invoices is essential, but if you want
them to work as marketing tools, you need to take this one step further.

Invoices that reflect a cohesive brand identity are crucial to building trust and customer relationships. Your invoice should include your logo, brand colors, easy contact options, and a link to your website and social media pages. You can use an [invoice template](https://www.freshbooks.com/invoice-templates) to add all these elements, ensuring you never leave them out.

The more your invoice reflects your brand, the more marketing value it
offers, and the greater the chances of customer retention. You can
enhance the marketing angle by providing a discount on the next sale or
promoting a special offer.

<br>

<title-3>SME Invoicing Evolution</title-3>

Like every other aspect of business, invoices are constantly evolving to
meet the demands of a changing world.

In 2022, keeping up to date with the latest invoicing trends will help
SMEs gain a competitive edge while establishing their presence in the
business world.
