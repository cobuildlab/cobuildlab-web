Miami, FL. May 12, 2022

Companies spend billions of dollars every year on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> software outsourcing services </a> to help them grow and improve. But is it worth betting on remote teams of software developers? The final decision will be yours, but here are some of the pros and cons of this strategy. 

The concept of remote work has been around for decades in the industry, and some companies have practiced it by **hiring remote developers**. 

However, the pandemic situation has accelerated migration to this modality. 

It has pushed a large segment of the global workforce to conduct a remote work experiment on a large scale that has never been seen before. Read on!

<br>

<title-3>Increase diversity:</title-3>

<br>

Diversity in the workplace drives innovation and productivity. This diversity is not just a matter of gender and ethnicity but also the cultural background, education, etc. 

When you broaden your hiring pool to include people who don't work within commuting distance of your office, you also gain access to a broader range of experiences from which your company can benefit.

<br>

<title-3>Saving cost:</title-3>

<br>

Another advantage of hiring a dedicated team to work remotely rather than in-house is cost. 

High-quality services are not cheap, but by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> hiring remote developers </a>, you don't have to provide them with office space, computers, etc., which helps reduce expenses. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/steps-to-follow-to-outsource-the-right-software-development-team/"> Outsourcing </a> is an excellent option for all companies, even larger ones not interested in having an in-house team.

<br>

<title-3>Reduce HR workload:</title-3>

<br>

If you decide to create your in-house development team, your HR department can expect months of increased workload. Recruiting, interviewing, background checks, onboarding, etc., will take up much of your time. 

If you choose the services of a dedicated team from an outsourcing company, this process is already taken care of.

<br>

<title-3>Larger talent pool:</title-3>

<br>

The ability to recruit/hire developers outside a designated market is a benefit of remote work. 

It allows the option to find the best talent that fits your company's needs without convincing candidates to relocate their families and uproot their lives for a new opportunity. 

Making sure you can find the right talent is a different conversation, but hiring remote software developers increases your odds.

<br>

<title-3>Better working environment:</title-3>

<br>

You'll have the freedom to set up your office where you need to be working from home. 

With telecommuting, you and your colleague won't have to do cumbersome things like wearing a complete formal suit, dressing up, and other complexities, all from the comfort of your home or office.

<br>

<title-3>Boost your teamâ€™s productivity:</title-3>

<br>

About 85% of workers allowed to work from home confirm that they are more productive than working in a conventional office.   The reason is probably that working with the development team remotely will eliminate travel time, meetings, and expenses. Not to mention that distractions in the office are abundant, and not all people are up for those challenges. 

No boss is looking over their shoulder, hurting their minds for working with passion. 

There's no superior nagging them. And there's no distraction for them to focus on their work. Even after time off, they are still productive.

<br>

<title-3>Flexible time for your developers:</title-3>

<br>

You don't have to stick to the usual 9 to 5 schedule with the remote development team. 

You can get up earlier, finish tasks in a short time, or come in as late as you want. But with flextime, you can arrange tasks according to your available time for the job. You also have the controls for scrumming.

<br>

<title-3>Communication challenges:</title-3>

<br>

It is necessary to have a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/improve-communications-to-increase-team-productivity-by-developing-custom-software/"> tool that facilitates communication </a> between the two parties since the remote communication, no matter how much technology there is, there is always the possibility of communication problems. 

This is one of the most critical factors when developing a software project because only this way can the developer know the goals and scope of the project and where the contracting company wants to go.   

<br>

<title-3>The developer's location:</title-3>

<br>

Your software team should have an office in the city/country you live in. 

For example, Cobuildlab is located in Florida (Miami), that is why our main focus is in the United States entrepreneurs and small business owners. If you are interested, we are a good candidate for your idea. 

**We are a U.S.-based technologic company, experts in software development driven by our talented developers.**

<br>

<title-3>Synergy between both parties:</title-3>

<br>

Establishing good synergy is crucial for the project's development, which can sometimes be affected. 

A product owner-manager is the most common and efficient solution for improving synergy between your ideals and the team.

<br>

<title-3>Distractions:</title-3>

<br>

Distractions come in different directions. When working remotely, no one is watching to see if the person is working or not. In the middle of work, you can abuse social media or take extra hours of napping. 
 
Nowadays, some tools allow you to monitor these tasks, so it is not a big problem. 
 
The vital thing, in this case, is to ensure that complete each activity, phase, delivery, etc.

<br>

<title-3>Time zone differences:</title-3>

<br>

May locate your partner in a different part of the world than you are. Depending on the time zone difference, this can mean that urgent issues will have to wait for hours before your team begins their workday.

This challenge was in the past if you hired a remote team with the same time zone.

Whether in the office or telecommuting, a developer has the appropriate qualities and tools to adapt to any scenario. He likes to feel part of a great team that dilutes the cons and enhances the pros. 

We are your perfect match if you want to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/"> develop your software or application </a> but do not have a qualified team.
