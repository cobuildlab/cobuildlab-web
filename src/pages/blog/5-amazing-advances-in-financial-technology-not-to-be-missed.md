Miami, FL. Apr 04, 2022.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/fintech-the-challenges-startups-face-with-financial-technologies/">   Fintech</a> <B>(financial technology)</B> has provided us with more and more ways to perform banking transactions related to economic activities at a business or personal level. 

The innovation has been of such magnitude that how institutions can serve their customers was unthinkable before.

These technologies have greatly helped financial institutions to offer higher quality services, with better response times, user-friendly platforms, and high-security standards. 

Nowadays, talking about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/top-fintech-solutions-to-watch-2022/">   financial technology</a> is very common. Everyone has contact with these technologies daily. Many platforms serve to perform banking transactions, countless applications with the same purpose, and others that help organize financial life in different areas. 

Below, we will show you five technologies that have revolutionized the financial world beyond payment platforms or mobile account statements. <Br> </Br>

<B><title-4>1. Chatbots and virtual assistants</title-4></B>

Smartphones and mobile devices, effective network connectivity, and significantly improved artificial intelligence have enabled the development and implementation of virtual assistants, such as Google, Siri, and Alexa. 

Financial institutions have started to efficiently use these technologies to create educational content to guide consumers. 

An example of this is Alexa Skill, a virtual assistant that can provide advice and perform banking and bill payments. 

FAQ pages are a thing of the past. Financial institutions can answer all their customers' questions with extreme ease and practically personalized attention with virtual assistants.

<B><title-4>2. Predictive analytics with Artificial intelligence</title-4></B>

Virtual assistants are beneficial, but the explosive growth of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/robots-that-are-revolutionizing-the-world/">   artificial intelligence</a> has given way to predictive analytics, which provides consumers with an even more personalized experience.

Banks now can gather data on all their customers and create personalized financial solutions tailored to each individual's needs in real-time, breaking away from the traditional savings or checking account model.

Banks can use this technology to design financial packages that meet the particular needs of each individual, and artificial intelligence, help with customer retention, loan acceleration, and fraud prevention.

Banks can use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-and-machine-learning-trends-to-watch-in-2022/">   AI-driven</a> predictive analytics to design individual financial packages for specific customers. AI in financial technology helps improve customer retention, speed up loan approvals and prevent financial fraud. <Br> </Br>

<B><title-4>3. Digital banking</title-4></B>

The physical infrastructure of banking institutions always generated consumer confidence, but that is no longer the case. 

Today, most, if not all, banks have an online presence; and this is now a fundamental requirement to generate the same trust as before with the physical infrastructure. 

The new generation of banks is betting on a 100% online presence without the need for a physical location. In this way, they focus on reaching people who use mobiles and other electronic devices to process their finances.

This type of bank saves a lot of money on infrastructure and, of course, on human resources, making it a very viable option today.

<B><title-4>4. Blockchain</title-4></B>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/blockchain-world/">   Blockchain</a> technology benefits both consumers and financial institutions. It has been booming for some years now and doesn't seem to want to stop. 

Even though cryptocurrencies are not quite fitting in as the most trusted currency, it is no secret that millions of people are flocking to the technology.

Many highly recognized banking institutions even use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/blockchain-revolution-in-business-world/">   blockchain technology</a> to provide various financial services. <Br> </Br>

<B><title-4>5. Internet of Things (IoT)</title-4></B>
  
There are many opportunities to explore the internet of things in the financial world.

As more devices are connected to the internet, the opportunities to exploit this potential increase. 

A clear example is insurance companies, which use this technology to collect information to offer appropriate coverage for each individual. 

In case of accidents, IoT devices can collect more accurate information for faster decision-making.
