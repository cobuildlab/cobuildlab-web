Miami, FL. Oct 20, 2022

The developer is a super-intelligent guy, usually called a nerd with glasses, who sits for long hours in the dark in his room writing code and doesn't have excellent <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/soft-skills-every-developer-must-have/">   social skills</a>. 

This is how we have seen him in caricatures or interpretations that are far, far away from reality. 

We will list myths and realities surrounding the vast world of the software developer and thus manage to stamp the actual image that represents this professional creator of technological solutions, what the career itself has to offer, and curiosities about <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   software development</a>. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>1. One programming language is better than another</title-4></b>

The reality is that there are many <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/being-a-developer-what-to-learn-first/">   programming languages</a> because some have evolved. Others have functionality that fits the project's needs or the developer's skills and habits. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>2. All a software developer does is write code</title-4></b>

While it is true that a software developer spends hours and hours writing code, this is not his only task, nor is it what he should devote his entire life to. 

Software developers, among other functions they can perform, are analysts and testers, being a filter through which projects must pass to determine their functionality, quality, and sustainability over time. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>3. More people are better</title-4></b>

There is a belief that if a project is taking longer than usual and errors persist, the solution is to add more people to <a target="_blank" href="aqui va el link">   the team</a> to finish faster and meet deadlines.

This is a big myth. If you add more people to half a project, they will be unfamiliar members. They will be less productive than the current members. 

The best thing to do is to get the team together, evaluate what is going on and how we can fix it, and get on with the work. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>4. Having the software developer in the office is better, and the remote one does not do his job well</title-4></b>

This is one of the biggest myths today, not only on the software development side but also on the remote work side. 

It is proven that <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/switching-to-remote-work-is-the-new-black/">   remote work</a> makes people more productive, which is no exception for software developers. 

With the ideal communication tools, well-defined tasks, and commitment, all project phases will be developed effectively. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>5. Software development is a predictive and linear job</title-4></b>

The common belief is that developing a <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/python-the-darling-of-backend-developers/">   code-based project</a> is just rewriting existing code and copying and pasting.

It goes a little bit - but only a little further - than that. 

When a <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/software-team-structure/">   software developer</a> works on a project, it's probably not like building something with instructions. They will have to determine how to develop the proper functions to meet the desired resultsâ€”also making these functions fit in with other tasks that will eventually be added. 

In short, it is a highly creative job that requires knowledge of user experience, design, and technology, among others. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>6. Adding a feature in the midstream is super easy</title-4></b>

The favorite customers are the ones who don't know what they want and pretend to be adding things as they go along. 

No, and thousand times no. The first step to achieving success and the desired results in a <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/software-team-lead-roles-and-responsibilities/">   software development project</a> is the proper planning and documentation of what the customer wants to achieve. 

Adding a fleeting feature in the middle of development will only cause conflicts that will delay the workflow. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>7. Software development is costly</title-4></b>

The common belief is that creating software can be very expensive, but the truth is that it depends on many factors, such as the equipment you use, the type of software, its customization, and its functions. Developing software can be affordable if you are clear about the software features.

These <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/myths-about-IT-staff-augmentation/">   myths are the tip of the iceberg</a>. Software development is shrouded in many urban beliefs, but it is a career that covers a lot of ground and does much more than what we have as a social stereotype. 

Likewise, developing software is not an impossible task, nor is it unattainable for those who would like to create something that provides a new and rewarding technological experience for their customers or to improve the internal processes of a company or business. 

The first step in creating something new is to consult with experts in the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   software development</a> field, and our team is always ready to code a great idea.
