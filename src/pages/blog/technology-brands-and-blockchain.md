We think that Satoshi Nakamoto never imagined the big businesses he or she will do with [the blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). This technology changed the world and the way we enjoy, use, and get money, processes in companies, the way to transmit information, etc. 

Blockchain not only has been used for **cryptocurrencies**, which is a virtual currency to do safer transactions without a bank, government or institution behind;  It also has been used in some distributed ledger technologies for access, validate, and update records without changing it across a network spread in multiple entities or locations, and lots of people in the world use it to transmit, store, save, and protect data on the web.

<title-2>Blockchain: the source</title-2>

BlockChain, it is a chain made of blocks of information that cannot be changed without affecting the other blocks. Why? This happens because the metadata of one block has information relative to the block before. This chain made of blocks is together on a timeline.

This technology is based on math operations so complex that an expert would take years to try to decode it.

This technology was used by Satoshi to create the [Bitcoin Network](https://cryptoradar.co/guide/bitcoin), and it has been used for many purposes.

It works like magic. And that explains the success it has had. For that reason, big companies like Amazon, Walmart, HTC, Google, and others are investing in technologies in this market.
