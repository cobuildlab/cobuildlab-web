Miami, FL. Sep 20th, 2021 -   With just three months to go before the end of 2021, it’s easy to realize how quickly time has passed. While this has been a good year for our team, many people have also decided to take control of their lives and pursue what they are passionate about. This was the case of Edward Zabala, a former lawyer who turned his life around by changing careers and pursuing his passion for technology and innovation by joining the Cobuild Lab team as a QA (quality assurance specialist).

A lawyer with more than 10 years of experience in the area of Corporate Law, in the public and private sector. Edward Zabala decided to change his career path and venture into one of his passions: technology.  We decided to talk a little with him:

**1. Why did you decide to venture into the world of software development?**

*"I have always been curious about various topics and technology does not escape from it, and in recent years I was linked to this world, through close friends who worked in software development and I was always paying attention to what they did, it awakened my interest.*

*Then the pandemic hit and during the lockdown, I took advantage of my free time to expand my knowledge as a hobby, then I started to take it more seriously taking course after course until I finally had the opportunity to put all that new knowledge into practice, I decided to take that chance and seize it to continue growing every day".*



**2. What motivated you to change careers and what has that transition been like for you?**

*" A lot of people say that software development is the future, but for me it is the present. I recently read that there are already countries where robots will soon replace lawyers; but instead of feeling down, I thought this could be an opportunity.*
 
*I consider myself an extremely detailed person -as a lawyer you have to be extremely meticulous with the documents you draft or what you say in court-, I like being neat with my work, maybe that's why the job of a QA was so attractive to me.*

*The transition has been a roller coaster, a very exciting journey because I love testing apps, looking for details or bugs, always looking for something to improve. On the other hand, although I'm used to working under pressure, it was a bit of an uphill battle for me to be out of my comfort zone.”*




**3. What do you visualize for the future at Cobuild Lab?**

*"My goal is to continue learning. I have been glad to work with a team that has guided me every step of the way. I hope to continue improving my skills as a QA and keep growing within the company".*
 

**4. What can you say to those people who are curious about software development and still don't dare to take the leap to step into this world?**

*"Don't be afraid, software doesn't bite. You just have to be open-minded to always learn something new, give full rein to your curiosity and be willing to put it all into practice. I am fortunate to share with a team like Cobuild Lab, who wants to support everyone who is learning and I will give my best effort to do a good job."*
