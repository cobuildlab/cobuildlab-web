Cargobot is a Miami-based, innovative, reliable, free and efficient technology platform that connects shippers with carriers, providing them with details about loads that need to be moved.  <br> </br>

It was founded in 2016 by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/catalina-machado-b35704141/"> Catalina Machado</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernando-correa-a12705141/"> Fernando Correa </a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavomed/"> Gustavo Medina </a>. With their expertise in freight brokerage, technology, and consulting, they knew that the current state of ground transportation wasn't ideal for anyone except the middle-man.  <br> </br>

The system that had existed for decades was weighted down with inefficiency and held back by old technology. They decided that the industry that moves America deserved a better future.  It’s a simple but genius solution. It’s like this: Cargobot gets a commission for every load that carriers move through the Cargobot app. On the other hand, carriers can directly negotiate rates with the shippers with no brokers involved. <br> </br>

 Shippers are able to list all shipments online. As a Carrier, you are able to bid on the loads you want, and when you win a bid you can choose how you want to get paid. Then, Cargobot will generate a rate of confirmation, although this has to be signed by the carrier first. <br> </br>
 
 Once a load is in transit, it will be tracked by both the carrier and shipper via their app’s handy GPS tool. If you're a carrier and have reached your delivery point, simply upload your POD on the app. Cargobot will generate your invoice, store all paperwork in the system, and also offer you a rating system. Whether you're a shipper or carrier, you'll be able to rate the person you've dealt with. This criterion is stored for future use.  <br> </br>
 
 In order to access the app, you simply download it via Google Play or iTunes. If you've signed up on a business day, They'll need a day to verify your insurance before using the app. You should be able to view loads and start communicating with shippers after that. <br> </br>

  ✔️Guaranteed carrier payment and shipment credit line <br> </br>
	✔️Flexible Direct pay options available for carrier per load <br> </br>
	✔️Shipper and carrier representative available with handling your account at no extra cost <br> </br>

  Perhaps the greatest advantage the platform brings is that it eliminates the middleman and hidden broker fees, effectively connecting shippers, owner-operators, and fleet operators in an accessible way while guaranteeing their payments.  <br> </br>
  
This makes it truly a win-win method for the cargo sector, helping make Cargobot one of the best start-ups established in Miami in the last years, where it has garnered widespread recognition as a top platform for its innovative approach in a crowded sea of tech companies.
