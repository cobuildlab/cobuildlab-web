Retailers need to deliver exceptional customer experiences to remain competitive in the digital age.
 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/retail-industry-a-non-contact-experience-due-to-the-pandemic/"> Retail software </a> comprises a variety of digital solutions that enable retailers to manage and automate processes inside and outside the store. 
 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> These solutions </a> can offer general retail functionality or industry-specific features, such as software for supermarkets, clothing stores, etc. 
 
If you want to know a little more about the **types of retail software**, here are some of them:

<br>

<title-2>Types of retail software solutions</title-2>

<br>

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/How-and-why-payment-digitization-goes-hand-in-hand-with-the-world-supply-chains/"> Payment processing software </a>:</title-3>

<br>

A payment gateway software is an application that serves as an interface between a merchant's website and a customer's bank that will process the credit or debit card transaction. 
 
In today's age of cybercrime, online businesses need to process payments securely and reliably. 

Although the details are more complex, payment gateway software does. Among its most common functions we have:


* Processing credit card and online payments
* Secure storage of customer payment records
* Creating customized invoices
* Creation of reports on all transactions
* Their status bank reconciliation

<br>

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/custom-inventory-management-system">  Inventory management software </a>:</title-3>

<br>

It consists of business applications that track, manage and organize product sales, material purchases, and other production processes. 
 
Companies can now use bar code or radio frequency identification (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/RFID-for-Warehouse-and-Inventory/"> RFID </a>)-based systems to see when shipments arrive, where raw materials are located and when their products have been shipped. 
 
By using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/software-trends-for-inventory-management/"> inventory management software </a>, companies reduce the time and effort previously spent on basic tracking and instead focus on analyzing, finding, and reducing inefficiencies in their model.

<br>

<title-3>Retail management software:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-for-retail-stores-2022/"> Retail management </a> includes the control of all business processes and activities that help customers purchase the desired products (merchandise), services, and experiences in physical or digital retail stores that they value.  
 
Retail management system (RMS) software combines technology that a retailer uses to power the customer experience and operate the day-to-day retail management processes, including software, hardware, telecommunications, databases, applications, and the point-of-sale (POS) platform.

<br>

<title-3>Retail ERP systems:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/enterprise-resource-planning-system"> ERP </a> stands for Enterprise Resource Planning. The basic principle of ERP is to consolidate the software used throughout the enterprise into a single unified suite that handles everything the company needs from start to finish. 
 
The practice of enterprise resource planning originated in the manufacturing sector but has quickly become essential to running a retail business. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/how-ERP-can-help-your-business-become-more-efficient/"> ERP </a> includes many pieces of software that are often considered separate. 
 
By combining them, data flows quickly, efficiently, and accurately from one business to the other and gives store employees and back-office decision-makers access to the information and functionality they need to do their jobs with the most excellent efficiency and positive impact.

<br>

<title-3>E-commerce platforms:</title-3>

<br>

An <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/custom-software-development-facilitates-logistics-for-e-commerce/"> e-commerce</a> platform is a software application where both parties, the seller and the consumer, play their roles. 

Essentially, consumers should use an e-commerce platform to discover products, shop with a cart, and then checkout. It’s one of the most widely used and well-known solutions today.

<br>

<title-3>Point of sale (POS) software:</title-3>

<br>

A POS system allows your business to accept payments from customers and track sales. It sounds simple enough, but the setup can work in different ways, depending on whether you sell online, have a physical store, or both. A point-of-sale system is used to refer to a store's cash register. 
 
Today, modern point-of-sale systems are fully digital, which means you can charge a customer wherever you are. All you need is a POS application and a device with Internet access, such as a tablet or phone.

<br>

<title-3>Omnichannel retail platforms:</title-3>

<br>

Due to the increasing number of devices that people use as shopping channels, omnichannel commerce has become the top priority for the retail industry. 
 
Omnichannel commerce systems are digital commerce solutions that focus on online and offline sales. They provide synchronization and traceability across all touchpoints, whether a website, mobile app, or an actual store.

<br>

<title-3>Social media marketing solutions:</title-3>

<br>

Social media marketing software allows users to manage their social media presence across multiple platforms. The software makes it easy to post, schedule, and share content on social media platforms like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/"> Facebook </a>, Instagram, and Twitter. 
 
Managing social media accounts and publishing timely, branded content can be complicated and time-consuming. 

Social media marketing strategies often involve creating and publishing content across different profiles and platforms several times a week. 
 
Social media marketing software simplifies this process by consolidating social media marketing management into a single application. Software features vary and can include scheduled or automated publishing.  

<br>

<title-3>Metrics & analytics solutions:</title-3>

<br>

Metrics and analytics are essential for businesses and marketers but should not use these two interchangeably. 
 
You can't have analytics without metrics, and metrics alone won't help you take action, understand what's happening or improve results. 
 
Consumers are more informed than ever and have taken control of their purchases. Marketers must be more involved in these stages of the buyer's journey, so they need this kind of software to achieve it. 

<br>

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/custom-customer-management-system"> Customer relations management tools: </a></title-3>

<br>

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a technology that allows you to manage all your company's relationships and interactions with customers and prospects. 
 
The goal is simple: Improve business relationships to grow your business. A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/what-is-crm-software/">  CRM </a> system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes and improve profitability. 
 
When people talk about CRM, they usually mean a CRM system, a tool that helps manage contacts, sales, and agent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-using-productivity-tools-in-your-business/"> productivity </a>, among other things. 
 
Can now use CRM tools to manage customer relationships across the entire customer lifecycle, spanning marketing, sales, digital commerce, and customer service interactions.

<title-2><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> Develop it customized </a></title-2>

<br>

In today's competitive world, the task of developing software exclusively to meet your specific needs is a necessity for your survival. 
 
Off-the-shelf software often does not meet your particular needs, as you don't need many features, or worst, you need one it has not. 
 
To avoid that, you will need custom software development services, and to obtain such services, you will need the right company that knows your goals, compromises with them, and meets your needs and requirements. 
 
The custom software development process also goes through several stages to get the final product. It allows software developers to take care of any hidden pitfalls and nuances in the custom software built specifically for you. 
 
At <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/"> Cobuild Lab </a>, for example, we make weekly deliveries and implement a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/sustainable-software-project-with-agile-methodologies/"> zero waste and agile methodology </a>. 
 
May include several departments in the first phase of the software development process. These involve engineering, marketing, general management, and research and development.

Business environments change rapidly as in the early 2020s, so retail people shifted their focus to e-commerce technology. Essentially, with the help of e-commerce stores, retailers want to bridge the gap between offline and online shopping by using software for process optimization and minimal human interaction. 
 
That’s why implementing different **types of retail software solutions** will be a plus for the whole year 2022, so start today and take your business to the next level.
