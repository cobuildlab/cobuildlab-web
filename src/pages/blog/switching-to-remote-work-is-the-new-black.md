Miami, FL. Oct 05, 2022.

Convenience, trend, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/innovation-to-your-business/">   innovation</a>... <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   Remote work</a> has gone through many phases and names that have described it and brought it to what it is today: a lifestyle.

The passing of time generates changes, and these, in turn, require adaptation. Companies are affected by these socio-economic changes and are forced - or somewhat driven - to evolve. <Br></Br>

<title-2 align="centered">The office was not left in the past. It just changed location: Remote Work</title-2> <Br></Br>

Although remote workers were previously spoken of with a bad reputation, this has changed radically, even taking a surprising turn in history where people have come to criticize the stay in four walls with a strict work environment: the office.

It has been a long transition, and 2020 forced it a bit. Still, it was inevitable that remote work would conquer the work processes of companies, regardless of their sizeâ€”the great transition of being more accessible but more <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/from-desk-to-dawn-how-the-remote-work-lifestyle-affect-productivity/">   productive</a>. <Br></Br>

Accepting the transition is the first step, as well as enjoying the benefits it brings:

- Remote workers work more. Seriously, it is proven that a remote worker takes up to 1.4 more days per month, which translates into up to 17 additional days per year. <Br></Br> 

- Although we may believe -even from personal experience- that remote worker takes longer breaks (which is true), they also work more minutes per day, so in reality, their breaks are shorter than those taken by someone in an office. <Br></Br>

- The reality is that office workers are more unproductive than remote workers. Office workers spend 37 minutes a day without working (not counting breaks or lunch) and remote workers only 27. This is also because a remote worker seeks to use his time effectively to perform other daily tasks, such as education, leisure, etc. <Br></Br>

- Boss over the shoulder.Not much to say. Constant supervision can affect worker productivity. Remote workers have said they are less distracted than in an office. <Br></Br>

Earlier, remote work was relegated to telemarketing or customer service. Still, its evolution has allowed any work area to perform flawlessly without the need to leave your home or go to an office. 

Education, sales, finance, retail, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   software development</a>, healthcare, and many other work areas have migrated permanently or partially to remote work with complete success, obtaining optimal results and better performance.

It all looks like a colorful transition, and it can be, but it should not be taken lightly like any transition. You should keep specific processes in mind if you want to move from office to remote and not perish in the attempt. <Br></Br>

Here are three common mistakes you shouldn't make when migrating to the wonders of remote work: 

<b>- From one day to the next.</b> Making such a big transition takes time and subtlety. If you tell your entire team one day that they no longer have to return to the office and can work from home, confusion may reign. 

Making the change gradually will give your team a better ability to adapt and fine-tune other technical details we will mention below. <Br></Br>

<b>- Communication.</b> At this point, tools are essential. Technology is on our side and fully supports remote work. Before making the transition, you have the tools required to maintain constant communication with your work team and be able to follow up.

You should never forget that your team will need to become familiar with the new work method and communication tools, so that prior training will be necessary. <Br></Br>

<b>- Assume that the remote worker is always available.</b> 

It's not the same as getting up from your chair, walking to the other office, and talking to your subordinate, co-worker, or boss. Now the distance can slow down communication a bit. 

It is necessary to understand that there may not be 100% effective live communication, but this does not mean it should affect productivity. <Br></Br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-Implementing-Test-Automation-in-a-Working-Process/">   Automation</a> is the key. Remote work must be supported by tools that allow you to assign tasks and deliver results. In this way, direct communication is only necessary in specific cases that can be scheduled, although not in an emergency. 

Remote work went from being the BOOM to representing the most normal thing in the working world. So deciding to make the transition is not the case, but choosing when to do it and planning it in a successful way allows for maintaining or improving the organization's current processes. 

When properly planned, the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/careers">   remote work</a> is better. Are you ready to switch?
