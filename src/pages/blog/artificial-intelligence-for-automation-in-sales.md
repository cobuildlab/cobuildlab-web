<title-2>But first, what is process automation?</title-2>

<br>

Process automation is a solution in which a process is performed with minimal human interference through technological or mechanical devices. It is the technique of making a process or system work automatically. 

Automation encompasses all functions in almost every industry, from installation, maintenance, manufacturing, marketing, sales, medicine, design, purchasing, consumer management, etc. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-Implementing-Test-Automation-in-a-Working-Process/">   Automation </a> has revolutionized many fields, and there is hardly an aspect of modern life that has not been affected.

It is critical to manage, change, and adapt your IT infrastructure and how your business operates through its processes. You gain time and energy to focus on innovation by simplifying change through automation. 

The goal of the automated enterprise is to get work done faster. That frees <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/it-support/">   IT staff </a> to focus on more critical problems, solve them and, in turn, make them routine and automate them.

<title-2>How can artificial intelligence be used to automate business processes?</title-2>

<br>

Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/how-and-why-should-a-startup-use-ai/">   AI </a>, there are many ways to automate processes within your company, but in this article, we will only be talking about 3, which are sales, marketing, and customer support:

<br>

<title-3>AI in Marketing</title-3>

<br>

* **Sales forecasting:** The application of AI in marketing makes it easier for marketers to understand customers and engage them based on their contacts and past purchases. You can predict what customers will buy next and the number of products sold through this system. Creating business intelligence allows you to avoid overselling or selling out of stock.

* **Craft personalized customer experience:** Brands can deliver personalized content and offers and world-class support to customers. AI is used to analyze the products you purchased in the past and recommend products that fit your needs. That is an example of how AI enhances the customer experience with personalization. A personalization campaign with AI increases sales, engagement, and customer retention.

* **Content Generation:**  <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-powered-robots-for-warehousing/">   AI-powered tools </a> can help content creators' jobs more efficiently and quickly. While the core of content comes from human creativity, you can use AI tools to maximize the efficiency of your content team by automating specific tasks such as email content, personalized reports/messaging, or social media content curation.

* **Dynamic Pricing:** AI refers to customized pricing. It is a pricing strategy in which the price of a product is determined by demand and supply. <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/mobile-apps-web-apps-or-cross-platform-what%E2%80%99s-the-best-for-my-small-business/">   An app or website </a> bot can monitor your predictive analytics use cases. Customers can benefit from dynamic pricing when demand is low.

* **Automated image recognition:**  Image recognition can better synchronize online content and store visits from a marketing standpoint. 

Many retailers track customers' in-store visits using <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/kairos-ar-rediscovering-facial-recognition/">   facial recognition </a> software and link them to their profiles to offer them a better online shopping experience. 

Others combine this technology with AI-managed push notifications to send real-time offers, discounts, and personalized messages to individual customers. It increases interactions between stores and customers and maintains their enthusiasm for longer when staying in the store.

* **Ensure data quality and privacy:** AI can improve an organization's data quality and confidentiality once fully and correctly implemented. Typically, marketers will need a large amount of data at their disposal. 

Therefore, it is crucial to have quality data suitable for AI to do its job to take advantage of <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   AI solutions </a>. AI gives you better data acquisition and prevents this rich source of information from being compromised by cyber-attacks.

<title-3>AI in Customer Support</title-3>

<br>

* **AI for well-informed actions:**  AI rapidly disrupts the customer care space with its enormous power to multitask and respond quickly to automated queries. By limiting research time and offering concrete action plans, AI-assisted automation of customer care platforms can generate accurate and fast responses humans cannot deliver.

* **AI-controlled Multi channels of support:**  AI technology provides direct customer assistance and can also be used to steer the customer service path. Sometimes, when problems become complicated, an intelligent support system will have the ability to direct customers to parallel support channels. AI for the customer service process brings a holistic balance to the support system. While customers receive efficient solutions, agents fulfill their service commitments and free up overworked support channels.

* **AI machine learning for extra support:**  AI works best for customers and service agents, even indirectly. Human representatives can receive the additional assistance they need to serve B2C customers. It can speed up the resolution process by discovering and providing timely solutions on behalf of agents. Machine learning enables customer service to be prepared for complex challenges that <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-chatbots-how-do-they-work-and-how-they-benefit-your-business/">   chatbots </a> sometimes fail to address by learning from repeated, frequently resolved problems.

* **Precise predictions and insight:**  The essence of the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-and-machine-learning-trends-to-watch-in-2022/">   machine learning </a> algorithm, it predicts what customers would want, which ultimately benefits customer service agents. Such predictions can be translated into future actions customers should take based on their choices, tastes, and content.

* **Uninterrupted service momentum:** One of the surprising advantages of using AI to automate responses is its independence from time constraints and vacations. It means that customers can interact with the AI bot to resolve issues. This uninterrupted customer service helps organizations be attentive around the clock to address customer queries. There will be a guarantee of consistent support to eliminate the problems faced by human customer service representatives effectively.

* **Demand forecasting:**  Forecasting is complicated but automatable. AI enables automatic and accurate sales forecasting based on customer contacts and past sales results. Give your sales force more selling time while increasing forecast accuracy.

* **Sales Process, Automation/AI, Can Engage and Nurture:** Some automated segmentation tools provide various emails based on where the customer is in the sales funnel and what AI has determined is the best wording, including the time of day to send an emailâ€”based on successful closings from previous customer behavior.

* **Lead Scoring Becomes a Scientific Process:**  AI can use past customers' demographic information so that marketers can compare it to their current leads and know exactly where to place their lead priorities. 

Spending time on charges that probably won't end up buying is inefficient and a waste of valuable time. In the future, those with low scores can be put on the back burner, time permitting.

* **In-store sales robots:**  This is mainly relevant in B2C. Physical bots are deployed in various types of stores. Given the costs and difficulty in replacing humans in various tasks, these bots will remain a niche in the coming years. 

* **Layout optimization:**  In B2C retail sales, AI-powered analytics helps businesses optimize in-store/ web page layouts based on customer behavior data.

Artificial intelligence for sales, marketing, and customer support can help businesses reduce costs and increase productivity while improving workflows that help generate more relevant results.

With the AI  automation process, companies can create highly accurate and scalable lead generation and marketing campaigns that allow them to connect with more customers and close more deals. 

AI in sales and marketing gives companies a strategic advantage in improving their overall efficiency, primarily when used alongside other methods such as predictive analytics and machine learning systems.
