Coworking (capital C) – It's not a place, it's a movement! That is why it cannot be simple to answer the question of what coworking is. 

**Coworking**, with a capital “C”, is way more than just a group of people working in the same place; it represents a whole new way of thinking about how we work and how we share with one another. Meanwhile_,_ _"coworking"_ or "_co-working_," with a lower-case “c”, is used to describe any situation in which two or more people are working in the same place together, but not for the same company; it is a generic word. 

We know this can be very confusing for sure; So, if you think about the word in general, it can take abode in places like an office, rental facilities and incubators, but they are very different from dedicated <a href="https://www.corporatesuites.com/benefits-of-coworking-space/" target="_blank">coworking spaces</a>. 

**_Benefits of Coworking._** 

While working on your own might have many advantages, a coworking space, offer more benefits and also may allow you to still maintain your freelancing freedom. The creative environment and the sense of community from like-minded professionals, it is perhaps the most appealing aspect of it, as sharing a coffee break, of course. 

Another benefit is the potential for networking. The people that you meet could be looking for your kind of work and/or they could be great resources down the road. 

**People who use _coworking_ spaces, see their work as meaningful.** Unlike a traditional office, this new wave of working consist on members who work for a range of different companies, ventures, and projects. Because there is little direct competition or internal politics, they don’t feel they have to put on a work persona to fit in. Working amidst people doing different kind of work can also make your own work identity stronger. Our respondents were given the opportunity to frequently describe what they do, which can make what they do seem more interesting and distinctive. 

The variety of workers in the space means that coworkers have unique skill sets that they can provide to other community members and learn from each other. Knowledge is living! 

**On _Coworking_ spaces you will be able to have more and more control over your job**. Normally accessible 24/7, but people can decide whether to put in a long day when they have a deadline or want to show progress, or can decide to take a long break in the middle of the day to go to the gym or even read a book to relax. You can choose whether you want to work in a quiet space so you can focus, or in a more collaborative space with shared tables where interaction is encouraged. You also can even decide to work from home - without repercussion- if you need to meet a repairperson or deal with a family member need. 

And while coworkers value this autonomy, they equally value some form of structure in their professional lives, because too much autonomy can actually cripple your/ they productivity, since people lack of routines. 

Coworkers reported that having a community to work in, helps them create structures and discipline that motivates them. **Fell part of a community!**Connections with others are a big reason why people pay to work in a communal space, as opposed to working from home for free or renting a nondescript office. Each _coworking_ space has its own vibe, and the managers of each space go to great lengths to cultivate a unique experience that meets the needs of their respective members. 

**Downsides of _Coworking_** 

If we already talked about the good things of _Coworking,_ we should warn you about the bad things as well. 

The biggest downside of _it_, is that isn’t free, but still it is cheaper than renting your own office. You also might have the same kinds of distractions as you would when working at an office: Interruptions from others, noise, and less privacy. So if you are the type of person who gets too distracted by others while working, _coworking_ is only something you should do sporadically; which is why you should consider your personality and work style before you commit to it.

**Traditional Companies** 

Many of you will ask yourself, what are the implications of traditional companies? An increasing number of companies are surprisingly incorporating _Coworking_ into their business strategies. Even though, the movement has its origins among freelancers, entrepreneurs, and the tech industry, it is increasingly relevant for a broader range of people and organizations. In fact, _coworking_ can become part of your company’s strategy, and it can help your people and your business thrive. 

So, if you are searching for a conclusion of what _Coworking_ can be, here you have three words that might describe it: 

Beautiful. 

Incredible. 

Challenging. 

And it is playing an important and unique role in helping us shape a world in which anyone can pursue a work they believe in on their terms, and find others with whom to share their pursuit. 

It can be a fundamentally new way of thinking about our relationship with our work and others. It exists because of our innate need to share, help, and socialize with one another. 

The world needs _Coworking._ The world need it to be bigger, more diverse, more helpful, and more creative.  

**Do you get it now? Can you explain what _Coworking_ is?** 

While many people are now familiar with the term, it is sometimes hard to explain, **Coworking** since it is still an emerging industry. You might have heard some people say “it is like having your own Google office.” And it can be. 

**Still having problems to understand the difference of _Coworking_ and _co-working_?**
