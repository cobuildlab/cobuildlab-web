In a market as competitive as the technological one, and even more so in software development, it is indispensable to maintain a very high level of adaptability. Technology evolves, people's perspective changes, and the passing of time creates new professional and creative demands. The constant challenge of the developer is to adapt to each new transition.

The products and services offered by a software developer change people's lifestyles and improve business processes. Therefore, creativity is paramount when selecting this profession.

<b><title-4>5. Patience</title-4></b>

Perhaps this must have been one of the first. The work can get tough between changes, testing, meetings, sleepless nights, and project deadlines.

<b><title-4>6. Transparency and honesty</title-4></b>

Remember, you always answer someone.

Decision-making power, responsibility, planning, and organization are essential to perform as a team leader. 

Writing code is not the only thing a developer does. <br></br>
