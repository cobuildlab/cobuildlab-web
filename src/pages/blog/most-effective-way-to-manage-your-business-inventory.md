<title-3>Tips for Managing Your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/software-trends-for-inventory-management/">Small Business Inventory<a></title-3>

Once you have efficient <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Warehouse-and-Inventory-Management/">inventory management software</a>, these techniques will help you manage your inventory:

<title-4>Fine-Tune Your Forecasting<title-4>

Forecasting accurately is imperative. It's the process of predicting what your customers will order, in what quantities, and when. Base your projected sales calculations on factors such as:

* Historical sales figures- put in place a repeatable monthly process.
* Predicted growth
* Market trends
* Economy
* Promotions and marketing efforts.

<title-4>Apply the FIFO Approach<title-4>

FIFO (first-in, first-out) is an approach where you sell goods in the same chronological order as you produced or purchased them (getting rid of your older inventory first). It's crucial, especially for perishable commodities like makeup, flowers, and food.
<br></br>

Similarly, consider using the FIFO approach for non-perishable goods. That's because even these items might suffer damage if they sit for too long.
<br></br>

How best can you apply FIFO in your warehouse or storeroom? It's as simple as adding new items from the back. The older items will always remain at the front.
<br></br>

<title-4>Employ <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-using-a-cloud-logistics-solution/">Cloud-Based</a> Inventory Management Software</title-4>

Always go for inventory management software with real-time sales analytics. An effective software should connect to your sales point directly. That way, stock levels automatically get adjusted once you make a sale.
<br></br>

A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/cloud-logistics-software-solution/">cloud-based</a> inventory management software will send you stock alert emails daily. You will always know what items are out of stock or low so that you can restock in time.
<br></br>

<title-4>Audit Stock and Identify Low-Turn Stock</title-4>

Effective inventory software will get the job done. However, you still need to count your stock periodically to ensure the actual store matches what you think is there.
<br></br>

There are several techniques you can use to audit your stock. Most businesses conduct an annual physical inventory at the end of the year. During this time, one counts each item in stock and spot checks to clear any stock issues.
<br></br>

At the same time, identify the low-turn stock, including stock that hasn't sold for a long time (at least 6 to 12 months). If you have such stock, it's time you stopped stocking it. 
<br></br>

Also, consider strategies to get rid of this stock. For example, you can offer a special promotion or discount. This is a huge boost that will save you both capital and inventory.
<br></br>

<title-4>Don't Forget Your ABCs</title-4>

Having tighter controls over your most expensive (the highly-valued) can be helpful. Most businesses do this by grouping their inventory items into three categories:

* A: Most expensive items with the smallest percentage of your inventory. These products bear the most extensive annual consumption value and make you considerable profits.
* B: Mid-range products that sell often but which hold them might cost more than A-items.
* C: The least expensive of your inventory. Despite making up the bulk of your inventory costs, these items contribute the least to your profits.

ABC analysis of your inventory helps keep your working capital costs low. You can identify the items you need to reorder more often and the ones you don't need to restock frequently. That way, you optimize the inventory turnover rate while reducing obsolete inventory.
<br></br>

<title-3>Wrap Up</title-3>

While the above inventory management tips are undoubtedly helpful, you can only make the most of them and ensure they work well by employing efficient inventory management software.
