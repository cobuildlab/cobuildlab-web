Miami, FL. Jul 04, 2022.

If you’re starting up, remote working can be one of the most effective ways to scale your operations while keeping your overhead costs low. But managing <b>remote workers productivity</b> can seem like an impossible task with so many distractions at home and in the office.

While remote working can present challenges, such as isolation and lack of face-to-face interactions, it also has significant advantages that can help your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   startup succeed</a>. Creating an effective remote work policy can increase employee productivity and improve workplace morale. 

The number of remote employees <a target="_blank" href="[aqui va el link](https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/software-development-as-a-service-sdaas-how-to-succeed-without-permanent-staff/)">   working</a> has steadily increased over the past few years, with 37% of U.S.-based companies allowing their employees to work remotely at least part of the time and another 13% having plans to do so in the next 12 months, according to a 2012 study by Global Workplace Analytics (GWA). This trend shows no signs of slowing down, as more and more start-ups are offering their employees the option to work remotely to attract talent and offer flexibility. <br> </br>

Remote work makes your workplace more efficient while increasing employee happiness and boosting the bottom line by reducing overhead costs. Here are four ways to create the best remote work management for your company.

<title-4>1. Get Tech-savvy</title-4>

<a target="_blank" href="[aqui va el link](https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/integrate-your-business-into-the-cloud/)">   Technology</a> is remote work's best friend. Talking about remote work management and organization without technology is impossible. 

Remote work is accompanied by video meetings, collaborative work, and digital management platforms, to mention only the simplest complements of this work modality. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/mobile-apps-web-apps-or-cross-platform-what%E2%80%99s-the-best-for-my-small-business/">   Mobile and web applications</a> are essential to maintain total control, which will allow you to track work, communicate with the work team, organize tasks, outline projects, store and share information, and many more processes that will depend on the nature of the workplace. <br> </br>

<title-4>2. Communication</title-4>

Communication has been called the most crucial skill in remote work, but that’s not saying much since it’s probably the most vital skill in any work situation. It doesn’t matter if you’re collaborating with freelancers or clients; effective communication will make everything go smoother and more efficiently while strengthening your relationships with others.

Currently, there are <a target="_blank" href="[aqui va el link](https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-using-productivity-tools-in-your-business/)">   tools</a> to maintain effective communication with the work team, such as Facetime, Zoom, or platforms specially dedicated to keeping work teams more connected, such as Slack. <br> </br>

<title-4>3. Daily task update</title-4>

Daily task update for the work team is one of the most critical tasks that need to be done to keep projects on track and ensure work remains moving forward. 

Keep your team members updated on what they need to do today and what they should be working on next week by creating the right mix of project and daily task updates.

The goal of task updating is to provide team members with an overview of daily activities and tasks, as well as give them insight into upcoming priorities, deliverables, and deadlines so that they can stay informed and complete their assignments accordingly. <br> </br>

<title-4>4. Faith and trust</title-4>

Although it may sound exaggerated, it is necessary to trust your work team. It is very different from supervising the entire team personally than having to do it through a screen where you do not see what the team is doing, fulfilling tasks, or doing it the way you want or should.

Remote working allows you to get talented people who exceed your expectations, but you must be confident that they will fulfill the activities. For the same reason, different channels are used to update the progress of projects and various forms of communication, as mentioned above.

Communication can be challenging in any work environment. Still, it’s tough in remote work, where there are fewer natural cues such as face-to-face body language or ambient noise to guide interactions. However, communication strategies can help you, and your remote workers stay on the same page and ultimately achieve more together as a team. <br> </br>
