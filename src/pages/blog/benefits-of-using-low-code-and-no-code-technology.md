The trend of using **low code and no code technologies** for the development of corporate software and platforms has increased significantly in the last years. These technologies allow developers and designers to save a lot of time during this process and save a lot of money for companies, as well as it is a great window for additions in software development. Surely you have any doubts about all of this, and to what extent it can bring benefits to your company, but rest assured because next, we'll show you a little more about these technologies.

<br>

<title-2>What is Low Code?</title-2>

<br>

Low code is nothing more than a technology used by developers and programmers to reduce development time and the amount of code manually entered by a programmer. This technology works by dragging and dropping visual blocks of existing code into a workflow to create applications or software. Low code software is built the same way as any other platform development, only that it offers a large number of shortcuts to reduce the workload of programmers.   

<br>

<title-2>What is No Code?</title-2>

<br>

The no-code technology works in the same way as the low code by dragging and pasting visual frames with specific functions in your line of code. But these are directed more towards companies or business people, who do not have much or no training on programming and software development. They are usually used in applications for departments or specific activities. So for amateurs, it can be a great opportunity to develop their first application or software.

<title-2>Some benefits of using Low Code and No Code in your software development project</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Low costs</title-3>

<br>

Using these technologies allow your company or business to save a lot of money, if your company does not require constant development of applications and software, you can request a provider of these technologies and train a worker in your company willing to take on the challenge of training in the development of platforms with these technologies, or on the other hand, you could hire the services of a programmer or company specializing in these technologies but only for a certain time, so you could in that way also save money. At the same time, the development times decrease and you need less development staff for this kind of application so it contributes to greater savings.

<br>

<title-3>* Less code</title-3>

<br>

These kinds of applications require little coding and are much less time-consuming and error prone than traditionally programmed solutions. Even developers can focus more on creativity and functionality, so they don't spend as much time on manual work and rework. Programmers like citizen developers do not need to hand-code entire systems from scratch.   

<br>

<title-3>* Quickly integrated changes</title-3>

<br>

With changing business demands, developers may need to change code midstream in the creation of an application. This can be a bit difficult for businesses as it costs time and money and is often a titanic task in traditional coding. With these technologies, developers can easily integrate changes and enhance application functionality whenever necessary. This streamlines the development process and significantly reduces time to market.

<br>

<title-3>* Faster time-to-market</title-3>

<br>

This is one of the greatest benefits of these technologies because thanks to the fact that many of its functions are compressed in many blocks, you only have to take care of joining them and they work together without any problem. With this kind of technology, you can deliver enterprise-level applications or software in as little as 2 or 3 days. 

<br>

<title-3>* Greater productivity and optimized collaboration</title-3>

<br>

These technologies encourage productivity since programmers have to spend fewer hours writing code manually, they can focus even more on other projects, which are more important and have a greater economic significance for the company. It also helps with the collaboration between teams, since if they are less busy they can help in other tasks of the department, maximizing the time of your staff. 

<br>

<title-3>* Easier maintenance</title-3>

<br>

When developing digital solutions using traditional software development, maintaining and updating applications can be time-consuming. This type of development approach often means that IT teams have to fix bugs or add new features manually to ensure that all new elements work seamlessly throughout the system.

The **low code and no code technologies** are changing the way companies and people develop their applications and software, as you can see they are great tools used today by programmers and developers, and even with people fond of the subject of application development and who want to enter this world. So now that you have seen all this, don't wait any longer and start your application or software for your company or business, or just because you are interested in it.
