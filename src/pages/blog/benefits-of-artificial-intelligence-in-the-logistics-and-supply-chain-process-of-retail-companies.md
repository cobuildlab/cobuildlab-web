Miami, FL. Sep 20, 2021

In modern supply chains worldwide and at any commercial level, are complicated and very fast due to the interconnected and globalized landscape in which we live.  With this speed in operations, the human error must be reduced and the efficiency of each of these processes must be maximized, which is why <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Why-to-Use-Automatic-Identification-and-Data-Capture-in-Warehouses-and-Distribution-Centers-this-2020/"> AI</a> has been gaining ground in recent years in this sector. Artificial intelligence has several applications in the supply chain, such as information extraction, data analysis, supply and demand planning, autonomous vehicles, and warehouse management. Here are some of the benefits it offers in logistics and supply chains:

<br>

<title-2>Artificial intelligence can help logistics and supply chain process of retail companies in the next ways</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Reduces operating costs:</title-3>

<br>

By implementing AI in your logistics and supply chain activities you will be saving a good amount of money, as many of these processes will be automated and carried out by AI systems.   From customer service to warehousing automated intelligent operations can run error-free for longer, reducing the number of errors and incidents in the workplace, allowing costs to decrease significantly.

<br>

<title-3>Using Chatbots to improve customer service:</title-3>

<br>

Another great benefit of implementing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Artificial-Intelligence-What-is-it/"> AI </a> is chatbots, which can improve customer service by providing a wider range of functionality improving search, sending notifications about new collections, and suggesting similar products.  With these tools you don't have to train customer service staff, you reduce costs and your customers can search more accurately and without errors in your product portfolios.

<br>

<title-3>Reduced shipping times:</title-3>

<br>

Thanks to AI you can improve delivery times to your customers, as these systems streamline the workload and eliminate many of the bottlenecks that delay work throughout all processes within your company. In addition, many of these integrated AI systems can analyze which is the fastest, most economical, and safest way for this cargo to be shipped and further improve the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/custom-software-development-process-in-2021-step-by-step-towards-digital-transformation-in-logistics/"> logistics </a> and supply chain processes. 

<br>

<title-3>Reduces risks:</title-3>

<br>

Automated AI-based tools can ensure smarter planning and efficient warehouse management, which can improve worker and material safety. AI can also analyze workplace safety data and inform manufacturers of any potential risks. This helps manufacturers react quickly and decisively to keep warehouses safe and compliant with safety standards.

<br>

<title-3>Increases Productivity:</title-3>

<br>

AI in supply chain management analyzes performance and predicts new problems and possibilities in the same domain. It uses the capabilities of various technologies such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning to determine problems in the supply chain. In addition, along with saving valuable time, AI-driven automation efforts can significantly reduce the cost and need for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Why-to-Use-Automatic-Identification-and-Data-Capture-in-Warehouses-and-Distribution-Centers-this-2020/"> warehouse </a> personnel. 

<br>

<title-3>Process Automation:</title-3>

<br>

Automation is the most important advantage of using AI to control supply chains. Through intelligent robots, companies can manage their warehouses and inventories seamlessly, performing tasks such as locating, inventorying, and picking the product. fewer people are involved, but business continues smoothly. Boosting the company and taking it to a whole new level of productivity.

<br>

<title-3>Anticipatory Logistics:</title-3>

<br>

Anticipatory logistics involves acting pre-emptively on orders before customers have placed them. This can be as simple as adjusting inventory levels before an expected peak in demand occurs or as complex as forwarding routes being adjusted in real-time to maintain a distribution of goods in warehouses that matches a demand that has not yet arisen.

<br>

<title-3>Increased space efficiency at the warehouse level:</title-3>

<br>

AI helps you plan better and improve the management of your warehouse workspace, the system manages to analyze the work area and the dimensions of each of your products and shows you possible options on how you can store them most efficiently and safely, taking into account time, costs, product output frequency, output disposition among others. In this way, you can reduce the number of containers you need or even the number of individual shipments needed to fulfill orders, thus reducing costs.

<br>

<title-3>Decreased transport network waste:</title-3>

<br>

This is another great benefit of IA as it allows you to group different elements based on their similarities. In this way, you can analyze your network of hubs, cross docks, warehouses, and other network elements to discover areas of waste or redundancy. Similarly, you can identify gaps where network elements could usefully be made available. Without any visualization based on analysis of the entire network, it would be virtually impossible to achieve the optimal balance and placement of elements to ensure speedy shipments at minimum cost.

<br>

<title-3>Better planning:</title-3>

<br>

Logistics requires significant planning that requires the coordination of suppliers, customers, and different business units. Machine learning solutions can facilitate planning activities, as they are good at dealing with scenario analysis and numerical analysis, both of which are crucial for planning. Similarly, it can accumulate, filter, and analyze gigantic data sets, AI is improving day by day in inventory management. The system can discover consumer habits and compare supply and demand to keep inventories to a minimum without disrupting the supply chain.

With the adoption of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/artificial-intelligence-development/"> Artificial Intelligence </a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/custom-software-development/">  logistics and supply chain </a> industry will change for the better. If you are new to this technology, now is the time to adapt it for your business.  AI is a relatively new concept in logistics and warehousing, so, naturally, there will be both positive and negative reactions. Thanks to AI, companies can work and manage their warehouses more safely and efficiently, making them grow faster as a company and make their customers more satisfied.
