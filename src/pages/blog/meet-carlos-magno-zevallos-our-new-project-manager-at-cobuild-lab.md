Miami, FL. March 30th, 2021 - There are new faces aboard Cobuild Lab and we‚Äôre excited to tell you all about them! Carlos is joining our software development department as our new Project Manager and Quality Assurance Analyst. <br> </br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosmagnozevallos/"> Carlos Magno Zevallos </a> is an economics graduate and a passionate visionary who has worked as a volunteer with various  organizations leading community development projects in Ecuador. <br> </br>

<block-quote> As our company grows so does the team, and we had been looking for someone who could not only plan projects in their entirety and present project deliverables, we needed a person who could think outside the box when facing complex product decisions, helping guide the direction of our development teams.  Carlos had proven experience in project management leading project teams of various sizes, while also having a keen interest in technology transformations  making him a perfect fit for us </block-quote> <br> </br>

A Project Manager at Cobuild Lab is a person responsible for overseeing different software development projects. Someone who monitors every stage of the development process so the project can move towards its completion by facilitating a project plan and all of the requirements to the development team. Now, Carlos will not only be responsible for handling some of our  company‚Äôs ongoing projects, making sure that all requirements, schedules, and deadlines are on track but he would also have to ensure that they meet the client‚Äôs expectations of scope as well as quality.   <br> </br>


We were a bit more curious about what does a Project Manager do, so Carlos kindly answered some of our questions:  <br> </br>

**Q: What does a typical day for a project manager look like?**  <br> </br>

*‚ÄúThere are several project f meetings every day and always a number of items on a to-do list, so as soon as I sit down in front of the desk, I‚Äôll be connecting onto our daily sprint calls where we evaluate if there are any issues, how can we solve them and to just make sure that the whole team is on the right track for each project‚Äù.*  <br> </br>


**Q: What‚Äôs the most challenging part of being a project manager?**  <br> </br>

*‚ÄúI believe that working with executives or clients and their expectations would be the most challenging part since it is a critical lifeline of a project.*  

*Project management is a strategic role, and in order to establish an effective strategy the first thing you‚Äôve got to do is to collaborate  with the executives or clients, you need to define exactly what they need and bring them into the process.  You would also have to manage their expectations, and this is the tricky part, you have got to understand where exactly the development team is  regarding the current project phase and then be able to communicate that progress clearly to our clients".*    <br> </br>


**Q: What‚Äôs the key to a successful project?**  <br> </br>

*‚ÄúReally good communication is KEY. During any project, you‚Äôll need to coordinate with clients and cross-discipline team members making sure that all parties are on the same boat, that everyone knows the requirements, schedules, and deadlines of a project. Establishing effective communication with your team members will facilitate identifying and solving any issues that could come up along the way‚Äù.*  <br> </br>



During his free time, Carlos works as a volunteer at TECHO, an organization operating in 19 countries across Latin America, which aims to overcome the poverty experienced by millions of people living in settlements, through the joint action of its inhabitants and other young volunteers just as him. For TECHO Ecuador, he designs, executes, manages, and evaluates different projects for community development around Dur√°n City. In his limited spare time, he likes to be active by working out as soon as he wakes up every morning, loves watching new movies, tv-series or animes, and playing Playstation 4 videogames.  <br> </br>

For us at Cobuild Lab, working in Tech means working in the future, from the Internet of Things to Blockchain every man and woman in the industry is a visionary and a passionate creator who thinks outside the box, so let‚Äôs wish Carlos the best of luck.  Thank you so much for reading!  <br> </br>
