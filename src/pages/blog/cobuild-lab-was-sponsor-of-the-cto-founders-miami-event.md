Cobuild Lab founder, [Angel Lacret](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alacret/), as one of the speakers at the event, explained how the MVP captures the essence of startup marketing. He talked about the philosophy that any entrepreneur should follow: avoid building something that does not interest anyone, learn the most by investing the least, and get facts to help correct the initial business plan. 

The event is expected to attract more CTO's, Software Engineers, and Developers to the South Florida Ecosystem.
