Communication is the foundation of successful human relationships, and productivity relationships at work are no exception to this rule.

In this post, we're going to take a journey through the most common productivity pain points our clients have had, but we go deeper into the importance of communication in this improvement process. Let’s start with reasons to improve communications to increase team productivity, specifically by developing custom software.

<title-2>Productivity increment starts with right and proper communication</title-2>

Suppose you have a multidisciplinary team that develops many different tasks.

Proper communication helps you assign and explain better what and how your team members have to do their job.

If that doesn’t happen, your team won’t have any idea about the process and resources essential to accomplish it, and you must invest more time and money to clarify them.

So, more meetings, mistakes, communication needs, and less productivity in general.

* **A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.atlassian.com/time-wasting-at-work-infographic">  study by Atlassian </a> showed that employees attend 62 meetings per month, which means around 31 hours a month. The same study found that almost half of employees believed meeting to be the number one time-waster at the office.**

* **The average worker spends 13 hours a week on emails alone, which means 28% of the workweek is taken up by email.**
