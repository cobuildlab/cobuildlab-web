Miami, FL. Dec 31, 2021.

It seems that while the numbers on the calendar keep moving in time, the word "Manager" is changing its meaning in terms of purpose and roles played by the people who carry it on their ID card or use it as a work or corporate identity. 

The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/tips-and-habits-of-a-successful-product-manager/">   Product Manager</a> is another level of multidisciplinary figure that we will see more and more within the organizational charts of many companies. <Br> </Br>

<title-2 align="centered"><block-quote>“There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all”. Peter Drucker</block-quote></title-2>

Most Product Managers come from careers such as business administration, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services">   business management</a>, business science or similar. This does not mean that people whose professional background differs from these cannot excel in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/achieving-product-market-fit-in-your-software-product/">   the field of product management</a>.

As mentioned above, the Product Manager is responsible for creating a new product. He is present in the strategy, passing by the planning, execution, and launch of the new product, coordinating all the teams involved in this process. 

A Product Manager is in charge of building the right thing:

- Is responsible for product strategy and its impact on the business
- Uncovers research-based user insights and problems 
- Finds and validates real customer and business value
- Prioritizes work against clear, results-oriented objectives
- Defines what processes are needed to reduce the uncertainty of product success in the marketplace
- Performs a product de-risking process to ensure the right built
- Aligns the team around the same product-directed strategy

Now that we know what a product manager is, his function in the company and the roles he plays in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/product-development-process-for-software-products/">   product development</a>, we can get an idea of the challenges he must face to fulfill his mission: Design, create and commercialize a new product. <Br> </Br>

<b><title-3 align="centered">What does the Product Manager have to face in order to fulfill his mission?</title-3></b> <Br> </Br>

<b><title-4>Generate new ideas:</title-4></b> A Product Manager is always on the lookout for new business opportunities, and attentive to evaluate new product ideas and/or product changes.

In addition to being the owner of the creative process, he/she is the one who specifies which ideas should be applied to drive the essential objectives of the product strategy. <Br> </Br>

<b><title-4>Identifies customer needs and desires:</title-4></b> One of the fundamental functions of a Product Manager is to identify user needs, using data from market research, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/buyer-persona-and-customer-archetype-for-software-business/">   consumer behavior studies</a>. His or her aim is to propose a solution, i.e. to satisfy these needs. To do this, he/she also conducts customer interviews, and user tests. <Br> </Br>

<b><title-4>Establish a product vision and strategy:</title-4></b> A Product Manager is the one who designs the product roadmap, and determines its commercial value. He/she also allocates resources, and identifies the key points of the product's construction to achieve the strategic objectives behind it. <Br> </Br>

<b><title-4>Evaluates the competition, and the product:</title-4></b> A Product Manager not only monitors the market competition and contrasts his/her product with the main competitor products, but also evaluates and tests the product on a regular basis, in order to devise strategies to extend its life on the market. For example: Tracks the reaction of users to its product. <Br> </Br>

<b><title-4>Define the product launch process:</title-4></b> Another of the functions of a Product Manager is to coordinate the tasks required to launch a new product to the market. This means that he/she must keep all the teams involved in the process aligned, and plan the implementation schedule.

So far, we have not only been able to define a professional who must be innovative. But who must also manage marketing practices to focus all the energy on correctly positioning the product he/she has designed. <Br> </Br>

<b><title-4><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/software-startup-investor">   Provides analysis and defines metrics</a>:</title-4></b> A Product Manager provides and facilitates other areas with reports, analysis and short or long term product forecasts. He/she also defines success metrics. For example: market analysis, customer analysis and sales and results reports.

The following graph by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mindtheproduct.com/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/">   Martin Eriksson</a> shows the midpoint of the Product Manager's position: <Br> </Br>

Mr. Erickson says: "A good product manager must have expertise in at least one, be passionate about all three, and be familiar with the professionals in all."

In addition to the challenges he/she must face throughout the role as Product Manager, this professional must meet the following profile:

- Flexible, delegates and knows how to make decisions
- Has leadership skills
- Has communication skills
- Has a number of competencies:
  - Product management
  - People management
  - Customer understanding
  - Product development
  - Planning 
  - Competitive analysis
  - Sales planning
  - Financial planning and strategy
  - Leadership
  - Cloud computing
  - Product marketing
  - Enterprise software, and the list goes on <Br> </Br>

As we can see, the competencies, skills, studies and strengths that a Product Manager must have are only equitable to the great work and role they play in the company they represent, with the great mission of creating a new product that, perhaps, will be the savior of the current finances of their workplace.

The challenges that a Product Manager must face start at school, with the multiple profile demands required for this position and the high responsibility that falls on his/her shoulders once they must be carried out.

We are talking about an integral professional who carries the weight of transforming the way in which something is created in the right way, with the right resources and offered through the right channels to reach that previously defined ideal audience.
