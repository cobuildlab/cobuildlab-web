Due to the COVID19 pandemic, the necessity of automation has risen in logistics and supply chain industries; <b><a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/process-automation/">  process automation</a></b> can mean an essential and vital factor for flexibility and resilience within these sectors.

<br>

In the post-pandemic era, anticipating risks, supply chain disruptions, errors, and having the ability to adapt to any situation have become pillars in the global supply chain evolution. 

<br>

“The most resilient and agile supply chains are designed to do more than simply resist and recover. They are built using processes and modern technologies that allow them to forecast, anticipate, and respond quickly to whatever risks or opportunities the future brings.” - <b><a target="_blank" href="https://insights.sap.com/what-is-a-resilient-supply-chain/">  SAP Insights</a></b>

<br>

<title-2>What’s an agile Supply Chain?</title-2>

<br>

An agile Supply Chain means the use of responsiveness, competency, quickness, and flexibility to measure how good and efficient a supply chain is based on a daily basis. What’s positive about an agile supply chain is the usage of real-time data and updated information. 

<br>

<title-2>What’s a resilient Supply Chain?</title-2>

<br>

A resilient Supply Chain is explained by its ability for resistance and recovery, which means, avoiding the impact when a disruption happens and improving the ability to recover quickly from disruption.

<br>

<title-2>Difference between an agile and resilient Supply Chain</title-2>

<br>

The truth is that when it comes to comparing these two approaches, agile and resilient supply chains are flexible, promote visibility that applies sophisticated methods to analyze internal and external information, and improve collaboration, through information sharing, forecasting, and replenishment.

<br>

<title-2>Benefits of an agile and resilient Supply Chain</title-2>

<br>

1. Operations are more efficient. Due to resilience, the risks are minimized, and because of that, the ability and opportunity to invest in innovation grows. 

<br>

2. Productivity improves. Researches have shown that productivity rises across the system when agility and resilience are introduced into supply chain processes.

<br>

3. Fewer risks. The supply chain means greater risks and loss compared to many companies in the area. Resilient and agile supply chain technologies minimize risks by permitting visibility into every operation across the system and network.

<br>

<title-1>What’s <b><a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/robotic-process-automation/">  Robotic Process Automation?</a></b></title-1>

<br>

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a type of technological automation that is transforming the way businesses operate. RPA software robots manipulate and communicate with your business systems and applications to speed up processes and reduce human resources workload. - <b><a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services">  Cobuild Lab</a></b>

<br>

Nowadays, RPA is being considered the key for successful Supply Chain Management, since it can amazingly increase the levels of efficiency, productivity and effectiveness. RPA in supply chain works automating processes that are developed and carried out manually, this doesn’t allow anomalies or errors to happen.

<br>

<title-2>7 reasons to transform a Supply Chain into agile and resilient with Robotic Process Automation</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Reason 1:</title-3>

<br>

Costs decrease. The performance of business processes can be replaced by software instead of a full-time employee. This reason also meets the quickness of an agile supply chain characteristic, because processes wouldn’t have interruptions or take longer.

<br>

<title-3>Reason 2:</title-3>

<br>

Email automation is a step that affects relationships and customer service. Efficient and agile supply chains need to take care of one particular aspect: communication. Maintaining and adequate communication with suppliers, vendors, manufacturers, transporting agencies, and customers is essential. Communication is basically needed all over the cycle; between departments, to follow up the shipments and deliveries, and even with the customer.

<br>

RPA can also be used to automate the communication process with email and text messages.

<br>

<title-3>Reason 3:</title-3>

<br>

Inventory management automation. Inventory is the core process of supply chain management, this means that suppliers and manufacturers must know the levels of inventory and also make sure that they have enough products to satisfy the demand. Here, one of the characteristics of an agile supply chain is met: efficiency. Through inventory management automation with RPA, suppliers can receive a notification when stock levels are low and even reordering automatically the products for a restock.

<br>

<title-3>Reason 4:</title-3>

<br>

Enhanced insights. This allows more visibility and develops a better decision-making process producing cost optimization regarding restocking, and inventory. Moreover, this means that personnel won’t have to spend long periods of time doing certain tasks but focusing on others that supply chain management really needs to focus on.

<br>

<title-3>Reason 5:</title-3>

<br>

Merchant selection usually is an entire manual process, with RPA supply managers you won’t have to worry about it anymore. When Robotic Process Automation is implemented the logistics in the supply chain change to be more efficient, productive and automatic.

<br>

<title-3>Reason 6:</title-3>

<br>

Reduction of procurement risks can be developed with process automation. Since this is a stage with high risk potential, it is essential to adjust supplier relationships. The adjustments would be the following: monitoring existing supplier’s performance, choosing new suppliers, and working out contracts. To complete these processes there are a bunch of manual steps such as form filling, document development, and notifications through email; with RPA this would become automated.

<br>

<title-3>Reason 7:</title-3>

<br>

Demand planning and prediction. This process needs information and data from multiple sources like sales history, sales target, fluctuations, price trends, shipments expected to be delivered, and so on. RPA bots are capable of automating supply and demand planning because it can be applied across many functions and processes and it supports enterprises and companies with demand.

<br>

A great solution for many supply chain and logistics management

<br>

In Cobuild Lab we’re constantly evolving with our services to meet the current demands of the market; and a great answer for challenges regarding process automation and RPA would be software development based on this.

<br>

<title-2>Know the main advantages of a RPA software</title-2>

<br>

- Minimize costs: the team's workload is improved, reducing resources.

<br>

- Errors are minimized: it is necessary to avoid human or communication errors.

<br>

- Significantly increase the speed of execution: it is necessary to reduce the time.

<br>

- Possibility of obtaining reports: these reports would be quickly and at the moment.

<br>

- Tracking: allows you to follow the traceability of the process at all times.

<br>

- Control of results in real-time: they can be updated.

<br>

- Eliminate paper buildup: minimize costs for both media and printing.
