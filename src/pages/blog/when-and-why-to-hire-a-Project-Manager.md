<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/top-project-management-software-tools/">   Project managers </a> play a critical role in any company, although that role can be challenging to define and easy to underestimate. 

Most companies wait too long to <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   hire a project manager </a> because it seems unnecessary until they discover that it is suddenly painfully necessary. 

Knowing **when and why to hire a project manager** requires vision, but there are some benchmarks along the way that will help you shape your imagination and make the right hiring decision, and we'll show you how:

<br>

<title-2>What is a Project Manager?</title-2>

<br>

A project manager should understand how projects run. 

They should understand what to look for in a project that could cause an issue. 

They should understand how to manage people and personalities and get the most out of their team. They need to know everything about project management. 

Many people feel that a project manager must understand the project's business or technology. Knowing the subject of the project is helpful, but any project manager worth their money won't tell you.

A project manager is a professional who organizes, plans, and executes projects while working within restraints. Project managers are in charge of leading teams, defining goals, communicating with stakeholders, and seeing a project through to its closure. 

The project manager is responsible for the success or failure of the project. The project manager is in demand in every industry.

<title-2>Why should you hire a project manager?</title-2>

<br>

Many owners often develop a vision of what they want for their companies, whether a technology upgrade or market expansion. 

These potential developments have established endpoints but lack the framework and form to turn them into reality. This is where project managers come in. Hiring a project manager is essential to give your project a more refined structure and direction aligned with stakeholder expectations and business objectives. 

Project managers provide the critical steps to your project vision using their expertise in the field and the industry-specific skill set and tools they have at their disposal.

Here are a few of the roles a project manager can play:

* Monitor a <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/tips-to-raise-funds-when-you-are-entrepreneur/">   budget </a> and come in under estimates

* Help founders transition to a big-picture focus

* Take management off the executive team’s plate

* Remove administrative tasks from employee workload

* Facilitate teamwork between multiple departments

* Communicate top-down and bottom-up
 
* Manage client expectations
 
* Keep projects within scope and on target

* Manage timelines, hours, and deadlines

* Maximize efficiency

* Minimize cost

<title-2>When to hire a project manager?</title-2>

<br>

Typically, companies look for project managers when they are already short of one, between 10 and 20 employees, or when they start to retain or acquire larger clients. Unfortunately, these companies have been suffering from inefficiencies and overwork for longer than necessary. 

Hiring a project manager before you need one may seem risky or expensive. Still, it helps you start integrating a project manager early enough so that everyone is ready for the leap to the next level when it comes.

You should contemplate hiring a project manager when:

* They want to enjoy continued business from blue-chip clients.

* They bag prestigious projects or clientele for the first time or exceed client expectations.

* They perceive that teams suffer from high inefficiency, overwork, or being under-optimized for more extended periods.

<title-2>Steps for hiring a project manager</title-2>

<br>

* **Evaluate your needs**:  A project manager’s responsibilities vary widely, and so can prospects’ skill sets and prior knowledge. Determine precisely what you want your new project manager to accomplish, and be sure to document it.

* **Write a job listing**:  Translate the needs you determined in the previous step into a clear and compelling job description.  Since the title of a project manager is so broad, you need to narrow it down as much as possible to get quality candidates.

* **Post your job listing**:  Use LinkedIn, your public hiring page, ZipRecruiter, or other locations for job postings.

* **Screen applicants**:  As applications roll in from your hiring platform, jobs site, or other sources, screen them for a topical fit like we’ve been discussing, as well as years of experience, PMP certification, and different work experience.

* **Initial contact**:  Conduct an initial round of phone- or video-based interviews, looking for the communication, leadership, and social/emotional skills necessary for the role. Find out what project management methodologies the candidates have experience with and which they prefer.

* **Final interviews**:  Invite your top candidates for in-person interviews where possible. Drill deeper into personality, work and leadership style, and experience using carefully planned interview questions. Ask candidates to show how they’d tackle an actual project or ask them to explain their approach to a past project.

Hiring a project manager is never a waste of resources. Many businesses and companies can attest that having a project manager on board cuts the probability of going over budget or project delays.

You have a higher chance of success with your project and boost your sales when the right project manager leads your team.
