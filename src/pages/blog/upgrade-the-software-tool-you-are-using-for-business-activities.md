Miami, FL. May 10, 2022

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> Updating your business's software </a> seems like one of those preventative things that everyone knows they should do but is often neglected. 

It is sometimes difficult to determine when to migrate or completely change your technology as a business owner because we have no help and direction from a specialist often, but this can and must change for you. 

The big question is, what are the signs that indicate you need to **upgrade your software** to stay competitive in the global marketplace and serve your customers well. Here's what we introduce you to next. 

<br>

<title-2>Some signs that alert me about updating my business software tool</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>When you have cybersecurity failures:</title-3>

<br>

Upgrading a software tool can solve security issues, especially if you develop an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-and-machine-learning-trends-to-watch-in-2022/">  AI or machine learning tool</a>. 

If you want to keep your company's data secure, an offsite backup solution is the best answer. Hackers can become aware of vulnerabilities in specific programs and exploit them to damage your computer system and steal personal data. 

Older versions of software can become gateways to your network. 

Software manufacturers notice these vulnerabilities and patch weak or exposed areas.

<br>

<title-3>When there is a problem about too much downtime:</title-3>

<br>

If your systems are taking too long to respond, it's time to take another leap. 

This slow response time may be due to poor Internet connectivity and faulty servers, or rather software slowing you down when using them. 

The frustration associated with these issues is excessive and sometimes demotivates your employees. 

Get feedback from your managers and employees as often as possible about the software toolsâ€™ performance. That Will help the IT person diagnose the problem to advise on better technology or upgrades with a internal or remote software team, as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/"> Cobuild Lab </a>. 

<br>

<title-3>When you diversify your company's purpose</title-3>

<br>

Sometimes, your company may be looking to diversify in different directions, making it necessary to develop new systems. 

It may reflect a change within an organization in changing goals.

Sometimes you may also need to make your employees more mobile to increase productivity. It is also essential to prepare for the future.

In these cases, you need to ask yourself where your company is going. 

If you want to expand your business, it's time to upgrade your technology to prepare for the workload ahead.

<br>

<title-3>Your software is not providing a return on investment:</title-3>

<br>

If you invest in technology service, you want your investment to produce profits. 

Providers with outdated software have difficulty tracking sales orders, customer/patient information, inventory, and compliance guidelines in a single system. 

The development can be delayed, lost data, decreased revenue, and lost referral sources. So, software should not only connect you to your data; it should allow you to see all areas of your operation in one place. 

Real-time visibility into your business performance can help you gain deeper insight into your processes and increase efficiency and your ROI. 

<br>

<title-3>Poor data visibility for decision making:</title-3>

<br>

You and your providers need to track and measure metrics and key performance indicators, but many struggles to efficiently. 

In some cases, they have a lot of data and can't find the correct one when they need it. A <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/artificial-intelligence-development">  new software solution of AI </a> could be the best solution in this situation.

Bringing data together for watching how different aspects of the business work together is a challenge. 

Without a more comprehensive business management system that automates and integrates information across the enterprise, it is more challenging to manage, measure, and make the right decisions as the business grows. 

<br>

<title-3>When productivity is going downhill:</title-3>

<br>

Older systems generate less performance and lower quality services than newer versions. 

Lower the productivity, the more likely customers will opt for companies with a more sophisticated method to be served faster and better. 

<br>

<title-3>Lack of integration with newer solutions:</title-3>

<br>

There are a lot of emerging technologies that your company could use to your advantage: predictive analytics, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/robotic-process-automation"> robotic process automation </a>, IoT sensors, you name it. However, your legacy software doesn't integrate with them. 

To use these great and powerful technologies, you need to modernize your entire business environment to benefit from the innovations. 

Only then can you stay competitive and become one of the best in your market.

<br>

<title-3>User interface and usability issues:</title-3>

<br>

Legacy software is often very user-unfriendly. 

Unlike custom modern, elegant, and easy-to-learn solutions, it was not built with convenience in mind; humans are expected to adapt and figure out how to use it. 

Legacy software can also be a barrier to attracting potential employees and customers: most want to learn new applications to meet the market demand for experience and expertise in emerging technology. 

<br>

<title-3>It has been several years since the last major update:</title-3>

<br>

The principle of agile software development is to have minor updates. Sometimes, it cannot finish an idea in a two-week sprint. That's when a significant upgrade occurs. The problem is that customers get important updates every two to three years, so software vendors should refresh the user interface with a redesign.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43820462/167637760-1cac2a69-cf87-46d5-8cd0-7c613186a021.png)

<br>

<title-3>When your operating cost increases due to software failures</title-3>

<br>

When your software is not running at optimal speed or performance, your employees take longer to complete tasks. While that time may seem insignificant, it adds up. 

Software updates optimize the performance, security, and stability of applications running on the computer. 

Keeping your company's software updated nowadays is vital to maintaining productivity and efficiency and providing quality service to your customers. 

If you feel that your software is failing, and shows these signs that we have mentioned, do not hesitate to get down to work and execute an upgrade or change of software immediately. 

Of course, this is adapted to your new needs and problems (customized). For that, seeks support and advice from technology professionals and software companies to make the diagnosis and change process more accessible and practical.
