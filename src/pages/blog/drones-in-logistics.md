Miami, FL. Oct 11, 2021

At some point, you have been in contact with drones for photography and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/video-marketing-software-for-2021/"> video</a>, or even when watching a news story about armed conflicts or wildfires. You probably know that companies like Amazon have used them in their smart stores/warehouses, but did you know that your company can use **drones in logistics**?  

Read on as we explain how and why. 

<br>

<title-2>Drones in Logistics: How Can You Use them?</title-2>

<br>

Unmanned aerial vehicles or drones can have many uses,  but specifically, in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/custom-software-development-process-in-2021-step-by-step-towards-digital-transformation-in-logistics/"> logistics </a>, you can take advantage of them in the following way:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-using-custom-software-to-manage-multimodal-transportation/"> Transportation </a> or delivery for customers.
* Scanning of pallets and goods in warehouses or distribution centers. 
* Search for lost merchandise in spaces that are difficult to access. 
* Surveillance and security of too large spaces such as warehouses.
* Access to areas that conventional transports do not have access to. 

<br>

<title-2>Advantages of Using Drones for Logistics</title-2>

<br>

* You save distribution costs in the long run because it does not require so much fuel. A single piece of equipment can cover very long distances.

* The delivery of goods and even products to the final consumer is faster because the travel speed of drones is higher, and air traffic is less congested. 

* You can extend your transport route, as drones have access to areas where conventional transports do not. 

* It allows you to have an eco-friendly logistics and supply chain process. It reduces CO2 emissions because it does not use fossil fuels. 

* More accurate inventory control in warehouses. It even offers the possibility of integrating the information from the drone to an integral system of warehouse management, and analytics by artificial intelligence. 

* Drones do not work in shifts. They can be operational 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

DLE is a free, multidisciplinary network in which companies, universities, governments, and investors participate. Its objective is to stimulate collaborations between these organizations, to innovate and standardize the use of drones in logistics. 

Embention's CEO, David Benavente, said: "Logistics is one of the main applications of drones that will allow us to see drones flying daily over our heads, joining the Drone Logistics ecosystem is a great opportunity to consolidate Embention's leadership within this segment".
