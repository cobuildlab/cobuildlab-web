Have you thought about the benefits of a <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/"> software factory </a>? 

For decades, software has played an essential role in companies because it helps to optimize activities such as <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/new-product-development-for-small-business/"> new product development </a>, sales, marketing, finance, and human resources, to name a few. 

In the new digital era, software is no longer just another mechanism to increase efficiency; it has become the primary tool to create value and ensure competitiveness.

Today, organizations must develop technological solutions that respond quickly and efficiently to customer demands and thus offer the best experiences. 

This new digital paradigm gives birth to the “<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuild-lab.com/"> Software Factory </a>” concept based on the industrialization and automation of software production processes to deliver quality experiences, protect sensitive data, respond quickly to market needs, and create operational software anytime, anywhere.

<br>

<title-2>What is a software factory?</title-2>

<br>

Software Factories are companies or groups of development and maintenance of information systems whose objective is the development of software for an end customer or third parties, according to specific predefined requirements and based on four basic principles: agility, automation, information analytics, and security. 

Predictable development activities characterize this model and reduction of the amount of work due to the reuse of components, generally focused on specific market segments, guaranteeing higher quality results.

Several essential elements of a software factory include releasing software on a regular, faster cadence, continuously refining development processes, and utilizing cloud native technologies to remove infrastructure toil through automation and self-service.

<title-2>Some benefits of a software factory</title-2>

The close collaboration between developers, internal IT staff, and business users allows for obtaining applications well aligned with the wishes. 

The use of <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/advantages-of-agile-software-development/"> agile methodologies </a>, the achievement of the final goal through an incremental approach based on quick intermediates, frequent releases, and continuous testing to verify the effectiveness of the interventions performed, further ensures the fulfillment of the expected results, increasing the quality of the software.

<br>

<title-3>High technical skills and knowledge of processes:</title-3>

<br>

First, it is essential to highlight the presence of competent professionals with continuously updated design knowledge and experience acquired in similar companies by sector and needs. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/steps-to-becoming-a-full-stack-developer/"> Software development knowledge </a> is therefore combined with the ability to understand the specific business context and apply methodological frameworks and best practices already tested in the past. 

The in-house IT staff can rely on a team of specialists who follow the design activities, recovering time and resources for other tasks. 

<br>

<title-3>An accelerated applicative time-to-market:</title-3>

<br>

Thanks to the agile frameworks and the synergy between the various actors involved in the development process, the delivery of applications, corrective changes, or additional features undergo a massive acceleration. 

By implementing its software factory, the business can have the digital services it needs available much more quickly, increasing the company's productivity and responsiveness to market changes.

<br>

<title-3>It helps contain development risks and costs:</title-3>

<br>

A software factory ensures the mitigation of risks associated with the development process. 

By adopting agile best practices, it is not necessary to wait months to get a new application or a change but to proceed with frequent releases, with small increments of bug fixes, the addition of features, or other improvements, which users immediately test. Thus, in the event of an error or change of priority, there is the possibility of intervening promptly, thus reducing the risk of finding oneself, after a long period of work, with a finished product that does not work or no longer meets the current needs of the company.

<br>

<title-3>Promote innovation and customer satisfaction:</title-3>

<br>

The software factory allows a better organization of the teams involved in the design process, which integrates more skills to identify application requirements and process best practices better. 

The gathering of multidisciplinary figures favors product <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/innovation-to-your-business/"> innovation </a>, with positive implications on the satisfaction of the company's users and, in turn, on the end customer. 

Innovative and high-performance applications make it possible to offer more effective services, increasing business efficiency and customer loyalty. 

Software factories are vital to accompany companies, from the initial stages of product development to the maintenance of the product after its operation. They play a fundamental role that can help your organization gain momentum and stand out from the competition.
