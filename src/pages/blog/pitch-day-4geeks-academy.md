The event was held in the main offices of 4Geeks Academy, located in the [Starthub Cowork](https://www.starthubcenters.com/?utm_source=cobuild-blog&utm_medium=post) right on Flagler St. Since 6 pm we sat down and chatted with the graduates, the mentors, the hiring partners, visitors and other members of the Starthub community in what truly was an exciting evening.

<title-4>Time to Pitch!!!</title-4>

Everything started with some welcome words of the Founder and CEO of 4Geeks Academy [Alejandro Sanchez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alesanchezr/), thanking everybody for coming to the event and briefing us about the projects and goals achieved by the graduates.

<title-4>Taap: Michelle Wiltshire</title-4>

The first project was TAAP, a modern and beautiful directory for phycologist in the Area, built by Michelle Wiltshire, sorry [Dr. Michelle Wiltshire](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/michelle-c-wiltshire-miami-fl/270139). Michelle is new in town, and with all her experience she explained to us her dreams to provide a space where you can look and find help on the web, really getting to know the person with which you can feel more comfortable receiving the attention that people you are looking for.

<title-4>Community Website: Skarley Guerrero</title-4>

After a really round of questions, we seat down again this time to listen to [Skarley Guerrero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skarley-guerrero-ab933311/). 

Skarley joined the program with a clear goal in his mind, to solve a recurrent problem in the Company where he works: [Affinity Managment Services](http://managedbyaffinity.com/), where they provide assistance and resources to community associations. 

He explains to us how disperse is the information necessary for the members of a community and how he plans to solve this challenge with his project: Community Website.

<title-4>Octopus: [Wayne Hall](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wayne-h/), [Alan Guevara](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanthinks/), and [Jay McDuffie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-macduffie/)</title-4>

In the third place was the Octopus: A Modular Reservation Management System. This project, as the team explains to us was born as a necessity for spaces management in a really easy, practical and beautiful way; starting with soccer fields in Miami, and with big plans in its future.

<title-4>Thanks for coming...</title-4>

The presentation was close by Alejandro congratulating the new developers and once again thanking the assistants for such a great environment during the event.
