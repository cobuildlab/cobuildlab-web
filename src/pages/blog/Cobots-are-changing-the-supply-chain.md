Collaborative robots (cobots) are becoming more important when it comes to working safely and collaboratively alongside human counterparts. Cobots are a great example of how robotics can be adopted in certain industries and contribute within a sinergic process, which is in this case the Supply Chain industry.

<br>

<title-2>What are cobots?</title-2>

<br>

“A collaborative robot, also known as a cobot, is a robot that is capable of learning multiple tasks so it can assist human beings. In contrast, autonomous robots are hard-coded to repeatedly perform one task, work independently and remain stationary.” - WhatIs / TechTarget

<br>

However, tasks for cobots are in a constant evolution due to their easy applicability, and the alleviation of workforce issues.

<br>

<title-2>These are some of the broad variety of applications:</title-2>

<br>

Packaging and palletizing

<br>

Assembly

<br>

Pick and place

<br>

Screw driving

<br>

Lab analysis

<br>

Machine tending

<br>

Quality inspection

<title-2>How collaborative robots are changing the Supply Chain industry</title-2>

<br>

1. Cobots are becoming easier to deploy, different from conventional robotic automation. Cobot manufacturer’s have evolved their goods to be fast and simple, and even effortless to implement. Collaborative robots are also loaded with sensors to notice the presence of their human coworkers.

<br>

2. The cost of cobots is continuously coming down, and manufacturers offer different acquisition options, from full purchase to rental. There's research made by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) that found that human-robot collaborations are even 85% more productive and efficient than humans or robots working by themselves, which means that ROI increases when deploying cobots.

<br>

3. Cobots bring many advantages for warehouse management. Minimizing errors because they’re more precise than human labour; less accidents and improved safety; collaborative robots are super flexible because they can be adapted to any logistic task, allowing enhanced workflows.

<br>

4. The evolution of e-commerce has left warehouse, distribution and fulfilment processes needing more when it comes to streamlined logistics. The objective is to accommodate demand and be more efficient and here is where cobots take part, because they can be used in multiple ways, specifically in dangerous tasks where humans are perhaps not the best alternative.

<br>

5. Cobots need less to maintain, this being positive for smaller scale operations, for example, small businesses. Collaborative robots are lightweight but with a rigid construction and torque-sensing capabilities. 

<br>

6. They don’t need to be complicated in order to deliver an effective operation in a warehouse. This will help increase the safety and the efficiency in warehouses, avoiding ankle twists, lower back injuries and upper body fatigue caused to workers.

<br>

<title-2>Did you know that…</title-2>

<br>

Back in 2012, Amazon spent $775 million on cobots that were designed to carry shelves of products from worker to worker. This with the objective that human workers can focus more on productive tasks.

<br>

Nowadays, Amazon has more than 200,000 mobile robots working inside its warehouse, and operating alongside human workers. Cobots have had a huge positive impact for Amazon due to the high expectations from the modern customer which they have met.

<br>

<title-2>Overall cobots advantages</title-2>

<br>

1. Traditional robots need tons of knowledge and time invested to program actions that can result in just a single action. Collaborative robots are user-friendly, they’re actually very easy to program and they will perform different tasks.

<br>

2. They are flexible regarding the departments to apply. New tasks can be effortlessly added to them. Great fact is that cobots could do the same for a 40 hour working week, but also perform a different task every day, which means, you can hire a cobot as a temporary employee.

<br>

3. Collaborative robots are very accurate and efficient when performing their tasks, a cobot will never deviate from its activities and actions, and they will operate tasks with the same power.

<br>

4. A collaborative robot can bring a positive effect on employees because they are designed to work with people, not to replace them. These are people-focused machines that can help employees to make and refine the task they perform easier. Moreover, those tasks that are dirty, unsafe, monotonous or even repetitive can be performed by a cobot, the employees can concentrate on more productive and essential tasks.

<br>

5. Productivity and process optimization increases, and actually that’s the main objective of robotization, because companies and industries want to achieve the maximum goal with minimal costs. With cobots, errors decrease, employees have more time to focus on different tasks, this means productivity increasing and a better operating result.

<br>

<title-2>A common concern: will collaborative robots take over the human labor force?</title-2>

<br>

This is a very natural reaction and it is very understandable, but in the case of cobots you only have to take a look at its meaning: “collaborative robots”, they are created and designed to collaborate with human workers, whether it is alongside them in the same area or rendering them redundant.

<br>

What’s a good thing about cobots is that they give the opportunity for companies to train their workforces and focus time and resources on letting them to tackle more skilled and value-adding activities.
