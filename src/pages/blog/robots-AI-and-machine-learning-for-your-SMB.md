Miami, FL. Jan 04, 2022


In the business world, staying ahead of the curve is one of the most successful strategies for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/"> your company </a>. Nowadays, companies are betting on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-powered-robots-for-warehousing/">  AI, robotics, </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> machine learning </a> and are integrating them with each of their processes inside and outside the company.

This way your customers will get better service and you can be more efficient and competitive. At the beginning of 2022, employees tend to perform less because of the fatigue of the whole year-past and incredibly this is one of the busiest times of the year for companies, that is why this would be a good opportunity to improve the performance of your organization. 

Next, we’ll show you what these tools are about and how you can implement **robots, AI, and machine learning for your SMB**:

<br>

<title-2>Since when have robots, machine learning, and AI been used for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/process-automation/"> SMB processes </a>?</title-2>

<br>

A robot is the product of the field of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/7-reasons-to-make-a-supply-chain-agile-and-resilient-with-robotic-process-automation/"> robotics</a>, where programmable machines are built to assist humans or mimic their actions. 

Robots were originally built to perform monotonous tasks such as building cars on an assembly line, food production lines, etc. But with the advancement of technology things have changed a bit and today you can get robots for household cleaning, assisting in incredibly intricate surgeries, for work safety like firefighting, and for military purposes among others.

Artificial intelligence has become very popular in today's world. It is the simulation of natural intelligence in machines programmed to learn and mimic the actions of humans. These machines can learn with experience and perform human-like tasks. 

As technologies such as AI continue to grow, they will have a major impact on our quality of life. It can be applied in any area of the company and even in different areas of our day-to-day life.

Machine learning is an application of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Artificial-Intelligence-Do-For-Your-Small-Business/"> artificial intelligence </a> that gives devices the ability to learn from their experiences and improve them without doing any coding. The learning process is automated and improved based on the experiences of the machines throughout the process. 

The machines are given good quality data and different algorithms are used to build machine learning models that train the machines with this data. The choice of algorithm depends on the type of data involved and the type of activity to be automated.

<br>

<title-2>Types of robots and AI technology used today</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Manufacturing robots:</title-3>

<br>

Industrial robots are robots that are used in an industrial manufacturing environment. Typically, these are usually joints and arms developed specifically for applications such as welding, material handling, parts joining, painting, and others. We could also include some automated guided vehicles.

<br>

<title-3>Robots for households:</title-3>

<br>

Robots that are used at home. These types of robots include many different devices, such as robotic vacuum cleaners, robotic pool cleaners, sweepers, gutter cleaners, and other robots that can do different tasks. In addition, some surveillance and telepresence robots could be considered home robots if they are used in that environment.

<br>

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/ai-for-health-healthcare-support/"> Robots for healthcare: </a></title-3>

<br>

Robots used in medicine and medical institutions. In the first place, we have surgery robots. In addition, some automated guided vehicles and some machines for lifting people can also be included in this type.

<br>

<title-3>Military robots:</title-3>

<br>

Robots used in military applications. This type of robot includes bomb disposal robots, different types of transport robots, reconnaissance aircraft. Often, robots initially created for military purposes can be used in the search and rescue of people and other related fields.

There are many other types of robots depending on their area but the most certain thing is that more and more areas are being integrated into the field of robotics, making them more efficient and significantly reducing human error.

<br>

<title-2>Why have these technologies been so well received and developed over the last few years?</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Reduction in human error:</title-3>

<br>

With artificial intelligence, AI, and machine learning, decisions are made on the basis of the previously collected information by applying a certain set of algorithms. In this way, errors are reduced and accuracy can be achieved with a higher degree of precision. Companies love these technologies as it allows them to be more efficient.

<br>

<title-3>Take risks instead of humans:</title-3>

<br>

This is one of the biggest advantages of artificial intelligence. We can overcome many risky limitations of humans by developing an AI robot that, in turn, can do risky things for us.

<br>

<title-3>Available 24x7:</title-3>

<br>

Thanks to machines and AI, companies can continue to work without any problems because they are not dependent on human beings.

<br>

<title-3>Faster decisions:</title-3>

<br>

Using AI alongside other technologies we can make machines take decisions faster than a human and carry out actions quicker. 

While making a decision humans will analyze many factors both emotionally and practically but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-powered-robots-for-warehousing/"> AI-powered machines </a> work on what is programmed and deliver the results in a faster way.

<br>

<title-3>Digital assistance:</title-3>

<br>

Some of the highly advanced organizations use digital assistants to interact with users which saves the need for human resources. Digital assistants are also used in many websites to provide things that users want. 

We can chat with them about what we are looking for. Some chatbots are designed in such a way that it’s become hard to determine whether we’re chatting with a chatbot or a human being.

As humans, we have always been fascinated by technological change and fiction. Right now, we are living in the midst of one of the biggest breakthroughs in our history. 

Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and robotics have become the next big thing in the field of technology. 

Organizations around the world are coming up with groundbreaking innovations in these areas.
