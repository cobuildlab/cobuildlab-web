As a website owner, you need to be aware of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/web-development"> website development </a> trends this 2022. Otherwise, you can have severe consequences for your website's performance and user experience. 

You can fall behind your competitors and lose traffic to websites that offer better experiences. 

Let's look at the **top trends in web development this 2022**. You will upgrade your <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/types-of-web-applications-for-small-businesses-and-startups-in-2022/"> web </a> app or website.

<br>

<title-2>Some trends of web development in 2022</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Dark mode implementation:</title-3>

<br>

The dark way is more accessible and easier on the eyes. It works better during daylight, causing less strain on the eyes, and is, therefore, more comforting to use. 

Dark-themed websites do not require brightness and therefore reduce battery drain. 

They offer a sleek user interface design with all other attractive features. 

You all would have known or experienced this emerging trend in website development. The dark mode experience has gained popularity worldwide and will be a trend in the coming years.

<br>

<title-3>* Users prefer optimized voice searches:</title-3>

<br>

In 2022, the global smart speaker market is estimated to grow by 21% to 163 million units. 

With AI assistants such as Siri and Alexa, voice recognition has made this revolution possible. People are opting for voice search over typing. It is safe to say that voice recognition is a growing trend and should increase accessibility and improve <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/user-experience/"> user experience </a>. 

Companies, especially <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/must-have-tech-tools-and-features-for-your-e-commerce-platform/">  e-commerce websites </a>, are already using this voice feature. 

<br>

<title-3>* <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-chatbots-how-do-they-work-and-how-they-benefit-your-business/"> Chatbots </a> are a great solution thanks to AI:</title-3>

<br>

The increased use of bots will impact web designs, especially UX. AI and machine learning have led to the demand for virtual assistant designs, which are more functional sound designs than visual experiences. 

AI-based bots have 24/7 problem-solving potential, deep consumer behavior analysis, and immersive human-like experience. This trend will be one of the most critical due to its growing popularity and usability. 

<br>

<title-3>* Developers are increasingly using serverless architecture and seamless applications in their projects:</title-3>

<br>

Serverless architecture results from exploring avoiding system overhead, data loss, and costly developments. Serverless algorithms were built as part of the cloud computing execution model. That implies that regular servers can be replaced by clouds that manage the resource consumption of machines. 

The trends regarding serverless architecture effectively minimize development and support budget, applications with flexibility potential, and more sustainable applications on the Internet. The technology is based on the use of function as a service. 

<br>

<title-3>* Increased attention to cybersecurity:</title-3>

<br>

Customers recognize this emerging threat and want companies to put stringent security measures in place to keep their personal information safe and secure. 

Companies should invest in their website's security features and use appropriate SSL certificates. 

Websites with robust traffic should follow the required security standards and conduct regular security audits—It’s one of the most critical trends in 2022 and the future. 

The risk of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/cybersecurity-&-artificial-intelligence-how-can-they-benefit-your-business/"> cybersecurity </a> threats increases with emerging technologies and dependency on technology.

<br>

<title-3>* Increased automation tests used by developers:</title-3>

<br>

Most <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/web-development"> web development </a> trends aim to achieve two things: a better user experience and minimizing downstream costs. Automation testing is used to achieve the second goal. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-and-machine-learning-trends-to-watch-in-2022/"> AI and machine learning </a> have been helpful in building complex projects with a team of few experts, while product automation confirms whether the product is ready for development or not. This approach allows the development team to test cases and learn from them to reduce costs, estimated at 20 percent, and reduce the test cycle period. 

In short, test automation will give you a better product at a significantly lower price.

<br>

<title-3>* Enhanced user experience with augmented reality and virtual reality:</title-3>

<br>

Thanks to the reality we live in today, these technologies have come a long way, and companies are betting more on them. 

Virtual reality and augmented reality work well with mobile applications, but web browsers can WebAR technologies in web browsers. Their speed and compatibility with other browsers are insufficient but will be improved over time. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/five-companies-that-use-augmented-reality-to-sell-their-products/"> Augmented reality technology </a> has a promising future in web development, ensuring consumer convenience. 

<br>

<title-3>* More implementation of Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP):</title-3>

<br>

AMP technology is similar to PWA and is one of the emerging technologies in web development. Its idea is to provide users with a seamless page experience to keep them hooked to the site.

AMPs are optimized pages that work quickly and have a convenient but basic layout, unlike full-scope web products. 

The pages become mobile-friendly and increase the readability of the content. Plugins like AMP allow users with different Internet speeds to access pages and make the Internet more user-friendly. 

<br>

<title-3>* Single Page Application (SPA):</title-3>

<br>

Technological advancement in web development calls for an end to outdated approaches. 

5G and high-speed Internet standards can help eliminate server-side offloaded pages from any click on the page. 

Most developers opt for SPAs because they work quickly and have a better chance of keeping user attention than any other technology. 

SPAs are more informative than regular sites and keep users engaged. Single-page sites are better equipped and can function without server-side code infused with API technology. This trend will continue, and all functional websites are expected to transition. 

<br>

<title-3>* Implementation of Progressive Web Applications:</title-3>

<br>

PWAs are famous for their accessibility and reliability, as they can access through any device and from anywhere. There is no need to download a separate mobile application to access it. 

PWAs are an advanced website technology used by reputed organizations. It offers smooth operation, less loading time, and a linear user experience. 

The concept is not so new and has been around for quite some time. But it is impacting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/web-development/"> web development trends in 2022 </a>.
