Talking about artificial intelligence still feels a bit futuristic, perhaps because of the way it's been depicted in movies and because of the connotation that was given to it when it began to be a subject of study.

However, it is no longer a matter of the future, it is a very tangible reality we live with on a daily basis. For example, when we want to see a movie at home and we see the recommendations by affinity or when we look for a plane ticket and then we receive recommendations for accommodation, car rental and everything we need to make the most of in the destination city.

And yes, it is possible to do all that with artificial intelligence. But it is not only useful in the entertainment or tourism industry. If you are interested in improving the customer experience in your company (regardless of your business sector), in this article we will tell you how to do it with the help of technology. <br> </br>
