<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/blockchain-world/">  Blockchain </a> is the hype in the technology world that has practical disruptive potential. It represents a scenario of interesting possibilities that could transform a plethora of industries. This process of revolutionary change in ecosystems, transactions, services, and operations results from a technological concept.

The Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), the broad idea behind Blockchain, is a concept of distributed agreement to validate transactions on an immutable register of these transactions. Mathematical algorithms and modern-day cryptography help build this immutability and impenetrable chain of distribution, an attribute that provides Blockchain with its biggest proposition.

As modern-day businesses move towards innovation that can create irreversible consumer behaviour, it becomes important for them to rethink their conventions. Blockchain, as a technology, revamps the idea of ownership and confidence by challenging the conventional validation process through a central party.

<br>

<title-2>So, how does it work?</title-2>

<br>

Blockchain is built upon the idea of peer-to-peer networks. The decentralized network consists of nodes, computers connected to the network, and independent parties. Each of them owns a copy of the ledger(Blockchain) stored locally on the system. These nodes participate in invalidating a transaction initiated by a user with a unique signature. This process is completed when the nodes engage in the consensus algorithm and verify the initiation.

A user initiates a transaction towards a receiver or makes a change in the ledger (or any purpose a blockchain is used for). This data is stored on the blocks of information where each block contains a reference to the previous block. Hence, making a stable chain of blocks. Once each independent node verifies the transaction (or the modification in the ledger), the block is added to the queue in the distributed ledger. Once the information is recorded on the chain, it cannot be changed due to the hashing linkage and time stamps on the blocks.

A blockchain that integrates digital tokens can represent any transaction, digital currency, fiat currency, and even financial securities. Transactions of physical assets can also be digitally represented through the same process.

<br>

<title-2>The main type of Blockchains</title-2>

<br>

Blockchains are broadly classified into two categories, public (permissionless) and private (permissioned). These types exactly represent what their names mean, i.e., in a public blockchain, anyone can access and make transactions. In a private blockchain, only permitted parties can engage and make changes.

The latter is used more by industries to maintain regulations and ensure higher security. On a permissioned blockchain, it is easier to develop safeguarding measures and manage digital assets.

<title-2>When Blockchain Can Be Applied To Your Business</title-2>

<br>

Blockchain can make intermediaries redundant in a lot of business processes. It also provides benefits with traceability with the transferred asset. Then there is its proposition of security that makes Blockchain highly relevant in today's world of technology and various business operations.

It is not just the financial world or the currency market that uses this technology's capabilities to explore new grounds. <a target="_blank" href="https://blockchain.works-hub.com/blockchain-jobs"> Jobs in Blockchain technology </a> are making an impact in all sorts of industries. Their unique way, supply chain, service providers, insurance, healthcare, and even travel agencies are experimenting with distributed ledger technology.

So, particular to your business needs, when should you choose to apply Blockchain in your processes? Well, every business has different challenges, but what Blockchain can broadly address is mentioned below-

1. If your goal is to manage digital assets through a decentralized record - Blockchain comes off as an ideal solution to transparently manage digital assets of various types. Even if the goal is to maintain digital relationships, Blockchain can accomplish it through the technology's 'Smart Contracts' aspect. One of the functionalities of 'Smart Contracts' is that it can release automated payments when parties involved agree on the terms of the transaction.

2. Exclude the time-consuming and expensive intervention of middlemen - Blockchain at its core is all about decentralized control. Its practical application has been proved in the finance, currency, and healthcare sectors. But the possibilities are far-reaching than what we usually notice in popular media. One of the most interesting endeavours of Blockchain is in the travel industry, which middlemen have always run. But some companies are actively deploying Blockchain in their efforts to connect customers directly to the hoteliers. The safe and consistent way of the transaction is not only saving costs overall; but also providing a better user experience. This is just one example, whereas the possibilities are numerous.

3. Keeping a record of data where it is constant current - Blockchain provides security and puts a record on that data through immutable time-stamps. In the process of having fresh and secure data, you will also have a historical trail of that data. This helps businesses make decisions for the future and build strategies that can be more efficient in capturing growth.

4. Manage and secure transactions between multiple parties - Transaction between two parties can easily be carried out by traditional methods but it becomes complicated when multiple parties are involved. Blockchain can be used to smoothen out such a process and carry out such transactions easily. The security that comes along with Blockchain is an added feature for such high stake transactions.

The aspects mentioned above of the application of Blockchain are addressing a broad spectrum but the scope is not limited to these four points. Here are some examples of how various industries are using this modern-day technology to change their way of business:

1. Supply Chain - This industry relies on record-keeping for its smooth functioning and has multiple stakeholders throughout the chain. Companies put in a lot of effort to ensure quality, status updates, and information regarding the origin of products. Walmart is amongst the first retail brands to integrate Blockchain in its processes to ensure farmers produce and evade instances of contaminated produce. These are some applications in conjunction with reduced malpractices across various stakeholders.

2. Healthcare - A blockchain service provider, SimplyVital Health, has developed a couple of products to elevate the service proposition by healthcare providers. ConnectingCare is one of two offerings by the company that tracks patients' progress after they are discharged. While HealthNexus, the second product, provides decentralized patient records that help in providing accurate medication and treatment.

3. Banking and Insurance - The banking sector was one of the early adopters of Blockchain and has benefitted from it in securing transactions and combating frauds. Barclays has several initiatives to accomplish the tracking and security of banking transactions. Various companies in this sector are dabbling with 'Smart Contracts' to enhance their service offerings like guarantees and automated payments.

Insurance is also a paper-heavy business, even more than banking at times. The <a target="_blank" href="https://blockchain.works-hub.com/learn/Which-Major-Banks-Have-Adopted-or-Are-Adopting-the-Blockchain-">  use of blockchain technology for banking </a> is heavily based on the technologyâ€™s enhanced security and transparency propositions. But, the application in insurance relies on the proof-of-insurance aspect of Blockchain. This helps companies to make a faster claim process. Smart Contracts have a great potential in insurance and can revolutionize the whole industry into something much more efficient.

<title-2>Why use Blockchain?</title-2>

<br>

Even though we have discussed numerous possibilities and benefits that Blockchain Technology can bring to businesses, it still comes down to your business needs. It can do better with the implementation of Blockchain.

Yet the application of Blockchain in every situation will at least have these benefits-

1. Blockchain gives an entire history of a database - Regular databases are just a picture of a particular time in history, whereas blockchain ledgers are a record of history. With Blockchain, you have information for that particular time-stamp and activity before that instance. This is how Blockchain provides transparency in the network.

2. It is not prone to cyber-attacks - Any hacking activity with a plan to manipulate records or enter a database fails in front of blockchain networks. Unlike centralized databases, there is no single point of entry or attack. Hence, making Blockchain highly secure.

3. Control is distributed - Control and centralization come with a high risk of misuse and lack of transparency. With distributed control comes uncompromised transparency and high levels of immutability. Blockchain keeps the records replicated in their entirety in different places and eliminates a central administration

<br>

<title-3>Conclusion</title-3>

<br>

Blockchain is still an evolving technology, and there is a lot to be explored in terms of what it can do and what it can't. It even has some limitations, like the high power consumption to keep the networks running. It was found that Bitcoin (the first product and cryptocurrency based on Blockchain) consumed 113.89 terawatts of energy/year.

Blockchain is yet to produce some proven results of efficiency in many projects. But, this does not mean that it is not the future technology; it is an evolving one. Early adopters and innovators in Blockchain technology will have a disproportionate advantage over their industry competitors.
