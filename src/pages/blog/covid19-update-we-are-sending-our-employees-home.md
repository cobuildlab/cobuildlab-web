Miami, FL. Mar 31, 2020 - Since the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15756&Itemid=4206&lang=en/"> Covid-19 outbreak </a> is now considered a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/pandemic.html"> pandemic </a>, we’ve decided to take the appropriate security measures to <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/covid-19-update-keeping-our-employees-safe/"> keep our employees safe </a> following the safety guidelines and recommendations given by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html/"> Centers for Disease Control </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019"> World Health Organization </a>. <br> </br>

On march 27, the United States surpassed China and Italy with more than 82,000 cases of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/world/coronavirus-outbreak-intl-hnk">  coronavirus </a> according to <a target="_blank" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/26/health/coronavirus-thousand-deaths-thursday/index.html">  CNN </a>'s tally of cases reported by health officials. And up to march 31,  the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at <a target="_blank" href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/">  Johns Hopkins University </a> shows on its <a target="_blank" href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"> interactive map</a> the exponential growth in the number of cases in the United States, rising to 165,874 cases keeping the country at the top of the global list of Covid-19. <br> </br>

At <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/"> Cobuild Lab</a>, the health and safety of our employees is the top priority and therefore we have *decided to send all our workers home*.  Since we are a distributed global team, as so we already have systems in place for fully remote work, so we’ll continue working together with the same way we’ve always worked—virtually. <br> </br>

We’re grateful to our employees for their full commitment to the company. Our team has a workflow that allows us to be always synchronized and thus, to keep up with our projects. <br> </br>

We thank our partners and clients for supporting our decisions, and we’ll continue our hard work to build great ideas. <br> </br>

Thank you so much for reading and stay home to keep yourself and your loved ones safe. <br> </br>
