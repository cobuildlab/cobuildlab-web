Below we will show you a little bit more about what this is about, some advantages and disadvantages of applying it in your company or business, and you can grow on a scale never seen before.

<title-2>What is IT Offshoring?</title-2>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/iot-development/">   Information technology </a> (IT) offshoring is the strategy of delegating tasks and processes to employees hired directly or outsourced overseas to move elements of the company offshore.

The most frequently offshored IT tasks are software architecture, development, testing, cloud computing, financial technology, infrastructure, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/it-support/">   IT support </a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/artificial-intelligence-development/">   artificial intelligence </a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/big-data-benefits-for-your-SME/">   big data </a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/AI-and-machine-learning-trends-to-watch-in-2022/">   machine learning </a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-Implementing-Test-Automation-in-a-Working-Process/">   automation </a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/cybersecurity-&-artificial-intelligence-how-can-they-benefit-your-business/">   cybersecurity </a>. Let's clarify any uncertainty and what these are all about it.

In the case of offshoring, people working abroad are company employees. They may act as independent specialists, be part of a small or medium-sized team, or form large offices. In any case, they work under the company's brand name. 

Offshoring in IT often involves an overseas office, a software R&D center, or specialized development teams abroad. These are popular tools for business owners to reduce costs and maintain stable growth rates. But there's more to know, so let's dive right into the advantages and limitations of the offshoring business model.

<br>

<title-2>Some advantages of IT offshoring</title-2>

<br>

* **Reduced costs:** Companies often offshore to reduce labor costs while expanding and streamlining their operations. If you hire this way, you won't have to invest in the onboarding process and infrastructure needed for an in-house team. By offshoring, you reduce these costs because the professionals already have the experience and expertise to do the job.   

Your offshore staff will also be responsible for your operating expenses. You will need to provide training with an in-house team, which requires additional costs. Having an offshore team will give you more financial leeway while you focus on your core business tasks.

* **Access to expert-level knowledge:** With offshoring, different skill sets are available for specific roles and positions. You have access to a pool of talented, highly qualified, and experienced staff and employ workers with the expertise your business needs. Since offshore employees possess specialized knowledge, you can expect better work quality, and <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/soft-skills-every-developer-must-have/">   skilled professionals </a> can handle your projects.

* **Scale-up and expand:** With your savings from offshoring, you now have funds to expand your services, improve your infrastructure, or enhance your marketing and promotional efforts. Another advantage is that it helps boost your overall productivity. Offshoring non-essential tasks will free up some of your in-house staff’s time, allowing them to focus on core business functions.

* **Round-the-clock availability:** The difference in time zones and work schedules can be solved by sitting on it and creating a system that allows a continuous flow of operations. Most offshore companies have a workforce ready to work around the clock. For example, offshoring to a country like the Philippines can be advantageous, mainly if your company is located in the United States, Europe, Australia, or any country in a different time zone, as you get the most out of 24 hours. 

Customer concerns arriving at any time of the day can be addressed quickly. The result is a better customer experience.

* **Reach new markets:** When you offshore your processes to other countries, you can work with a diverse range of people who can help you market your products or services to new customers. This will help facilitate your scaling efforts, enabling you to grow your business while streamlining operations.

<title-2>Challenges of IT Offshoring</title-2>

<br>

* **Insufficient Language Skills:** When shifting services to foreign countries, you may need more people with proper language skills in their region. This factor may significantly hinder understanding and decrease communication efficiency.

* **Lack of Technological Advancements:** Delivering part of your operations abroad may allow your business to choose a country with sufficient technological capabilities. These include poor infrastructure, a need for more developers with exceptional skills, and a unique technology stack. That’s why you should choose an offshore destination carefully.

* **Cultural Barriers:** Cultural differences may weaken rapport and hinder practical cooperation. Involving employees with opposite values can result in performance control or subordination difficulties. Thus, consider like-minded cultures with similar work ethics.

* **Time Difference:** Another pain point may be a significant time difference. Unless you’ve agreed that they must respond immediately, you could wait a long to receive a response from your employees. Because of the time difference, some employees might also need to work night shifts.


 One of the biggest challenges of **IT offshoring** is hiring foreign employees. Hiring can be a long and challenging process; however, it doesn't have to be, especially after 2020 ushered in the year of the virtual workplace. Take advantage of tools like Indeed, LinkedIn, and other job sites, and use <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/artificial-intelligence-development/">   artificial intelligence </a> in your search if you have it at your disposal. This will help you source more relevant employees who fit your business and culture well. If you need help, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   contact us </a>. So don't wait any longer and start expanding your team worldwide; enjoy these benefits and make yourself known, don't wait any longer.
