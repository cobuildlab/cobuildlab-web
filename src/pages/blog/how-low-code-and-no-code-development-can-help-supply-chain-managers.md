It’s well known that Supply Chain and Logistics are going through dramatic transformations and evolutions into the digital age. These industries are able to overcome challenges with the appliance of IoT, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence (AI), process automation, data analysis, software development, etc.

<br>

To make this happen, Supply Chain and Logistics enterprises need to gather and access data, increase visibility, and even manage complex operations and processes. This is where Low-Code and No-Code Development is playing a huge and important role.

<br>

Now, to clear things up, let’s make a quick review about what each of these terms means:

<br>

<title-2>1. What’s low-code?</title-2>

<br>

This is a visual method for development. Low-code basically lets you abstract and automate every part and step of an application lifecycle to create a framework for different solutions. The methods applied in low-code are drag-and-drop or adding application components to create a whole app, instead of extensive coding language. Low-code requires some programming understanding. 

<br>

<title-2>2. What’s no-code?</title-2>

<br>

<b>No-code applies a visual environment to allow layman users to create an app.</b> Tools are generally pre-configured in this scenario and anyone (really, anyone), can build an app using this alternative. No-code is designed for everyone.

Our current reality shows that few people in the Supply Chain or Logistics industries have knowledge or expertise regarding developing or programming, that’s the reason why digital transformation demand is going higher than expected, but, low-code and no-code app development can lessen this challenge.

<br>

<title-2>How can low-code and no-code help Supply Chain Managers?</title-2>

<br>

- Low-code and no-code software solutions can <b>empower people and employees to be proactive</b> in developing alternatives to analyze, monitor, manage, and leverage the data generated today.

- <b>Low-code is actually described as “virtual lego blocks that users can move around with a mouse and a cursor.”</b> - CIO

- No-code and low-code empowers Supply Chain and Logistics employees to act on their creativity to develop productive and profitable tools based on their needs. On the other hand, these development solutions can boost the proactivity of employees based on certain industry departments which means the employee engagement is increased provide the tools to work faster, diminish app backlogs, and link trending technology with legacy systems.

<br>

<title-2>Benefits of low-code and no-code for Supply Chain Enterprises</title-4>

<br>

<b>Agility and visibility increases.</b> Eliminating manual processes and Excel spreadsheets can reduce costs and risks.

<br>

<b>Decision-making communication improvement.</b> Supply chain professionals can gain transparency.

<br>

<b>Data centralization.</b> With information that is locked in core systems and being centralized, supply chain managers can improve the delivery time of materials and instill better communication amongst vendors, teams, and suppliers.

<br>

<b>Real-time insights to identify risks automatically.<b>
  
<br>

<b>Increase the automation of unique enterprise’s processes.</b>
  
<br>

<b>More ways to communicate with customers and providers, for example, chatbots or even WhatsApp.</b>
  
<br>

<b>Meet the demands of customers' answers, questions, and expectatives.</b>
  
<br>

<b>If you are an online supply chain company this means that you no longer rely on the traditional supply chain model.</b> These companies need and rely on technology, because they depend on it to visualize stock, plan delivery routes, fleets, and manage returns. With low-code and no-code processes, such as response to complex features and developments, managers can actually give solutions to these even faster and in a more user-friendly way.

<b>When traditional supply chain providers need to find a way to digital transformation,</b> low-code and no-code automation is a great alternative for them, because these solutions provide IoT, Machine Learning (ML), and blockchain to deliver new values and competitive advantages to a business. 

<b>Supply Chain Managers need dynamic solutions</b> that can be updated easily to make them more flexible for the upcoming changes and digital evolutions in the industries.

<br>

<title-2>Advantages of these solutions for Supply Chain Management</title-2>

<br>  

Developers put supply chain customers in control of their own applications and software.

Customers will be able to easily build supply chain alternatives related to interfaces, integrations, and applications.

Customers will reduce their costs, risks, delays, issues, and more.

Specific configurations can be designed and developed to meet the certain and unique needs of the customers.

<br>

<title-2>Why choosing low-code and no-code platforms for Supply Chain companies?</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Reason 1:</title-3>

Saves money. Supply chain companies don’t have to bring external development companies or teams to develop software solutions.

<title-3>Reason 2:</title-3>

Low-code and no-code development platforms can help companies link the skills gap by enabling existing IT staff and non-developers to build mobile apps quickly and easily. - SCTimes

<title-3>Reason 3:</title-3>

Faster development. It takes up to 6 months to develop a traditional app or software solution. In the case of low-code and no-code, staff can update features along with the development process.

<title-3>Reason 4:</title-3>
  
The amount of coding needed is reduced. Existing employees and staff can be able to develop sophisticated and functional apps.
