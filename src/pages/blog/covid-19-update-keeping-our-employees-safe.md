Miami, FL. Mar 13, 2020 - On March 11 the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/es"> World Health Organization (WHO) </a> announced their <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15756:la-oms-caracteriza-a-covid-19-como-una-pandemia&catid=740&lang=en&Itemid=1926"> decision </a> to consider the outbreak of the new Coronavirus a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/pandemic.html"> pandemic </a> and Cobuild Lab will take the appropriate security measures to keep our employees safe. <br> </br>

According to the WHO, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen"> up to March 11 </a>, 118,000 cases of infection had been reported in 114 countries and 4,291 people had died. According to  Tedros Adhanom, director of the WHO, these figures are expected to increase, so he called on governments to take "urgent and aggressive measures" to combat the outbreak. <br> </br>

At <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/"> Cobuild Lab </a>, the health and safety of our employees is the top priority. With a multidisciplinary team and customers who depend on our services, we want to maintain a proper workflow following the safety guidelines and recommendations given by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html"> Centers for Disease Control </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019"> World Health Organization </a>.  These are all the actions that will be taken in our company: <br> </br>

* We have decided to pause all domestic and international business travel. This position will remain in place for the next few weeks. <br> </br>

 * We’re a distributed global team, as so we already have systems in place for fully remote work. Therefore, we’ll continue to work together, the same way we’ve always worked—virtually.<br> </br>
 
 * We ask all employees who are sick to take some time to rest at home. <br> </br>
 
 * Meetings with clients or between teams in distant offices will be held via web. <br> </br>
 
 * We’re conducting preventive cleaning and sanitization in our U.S and Latin American offices to minimize the risk of contagious. <br> </br>
 
 * We ask all employees to clean up frequently touched surfaces in the workplace, such as workstations, countertops, and doorknobs. <br> </br>
 
 * We will provide disposable wipes so that commonly used surfaces (for example, doorknobs, keyboards, remote controls, desks) can be wiped down by employees before each use. <br> </br>
 
 * Employees who are well but who have a sick family member at home with COVID-19 should notify their supervisor and refer to CDC guidance for how to conduct a risk assessment of their potential exposure. <br> </br>
