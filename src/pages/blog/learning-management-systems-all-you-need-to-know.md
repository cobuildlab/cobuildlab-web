Using technology in favor of education is a great advantage not only for educational institutions but also for all types of companies. LMS platforms allow the virtual environment to serve as a medium for teaching and learning.

Digital transformation has given us access to the most diverse information, and thanks to the internet, an easy way to solve any type of doubt or curiosity. However, the network can also be used for a more formal teaching-learning process, using the appropriate tools for this, and here's where LMS platforms come into play.


<title-3 align="centered">  What is an LMS platform and what is it for?  </title-3>

An LMS (Learning Management System) platform is a support tool for the distance or semi-face-to-face teaching-learning process.

This platform uses technology to reproduce all the resources and tools of a face-to-face class in the virtual environment. Thanks to it, it’s possible to create, store, distribute and manage various virtual educational activities.

They are useful for both companies and educational institutions looking for an effective training method in which the physical presence of the participants is not necessary. <br> </br>


<title-3 align="centered">  What are the main characteristics of an LMS platform?   </title-3>

Now that you know what a virtual learning platform is, we'll show you what its basic characteristics are:

🔹 **Interactivity**
Contrary to what many people think, an LMS platform involves frequent user interactions.

The teaching-learning process does not occur in just one way. For each teaching action, a user reaction is required that makes learning possible. This dynamism allows the success of the objective.

🔹 **Scalability**
The number of users is not limited. This number can grow as needed. It is possible to increase the capacity of users without losing the quality of teaching. Something totally different from what happens in a real environment.

🔹 **Inclusive**
It allows people with certain disabilities to have access to education in the same way as anyone else. In this way, e-learning platforms become a totally inclusive system for learning.

🔹 **Functionality**
The platform can be adapted to the needs and requirements of users, allowing adaptation for various types of requirements.

🔹 **Flexibility**
It adapts in every sense to any type of training or course, regardless of the needs of both the creators of the teaching program and the students themselves.

🔹 **Ubiquity**
It allows the user to find everything they need to carry out the required activities without difficulty and consequently everything that is essential to successfully complete their learning.

🔹 **Integration**
The platform can be integrated with other tools or applications, providing more complete learning according to the specific needs of the training.

🔹 **Omnipresent**
The courses on the LMS platform can be accessed anywhere in the world and at any time from a mobile device or computer with Internet access. <br> </br>


<title-3 align="centered">  4 Benefits of an LMS platform  </title-3>

Among the characteristics of LMS platforms, it is already possible to distinguish some of their advantages. Here are 4 of its main benefits:

**1. Reduce training costs**
There are LMS platforms of various prices, there are even those for free use. Even choosing a paid platform, the expenses compared to a face-to-face training course are much lower.
Considering the expenses of printed material, payment of instructors, per diem, physical location, etc., you can be sure that the savings will be significant and the investment will not hurt your budget.

**2. No great knowledge is needed**
Creating a course on an LMS platform is not a task that requires deep computer skills. Most of these platforms are quite intuitive. Part of the principle is that the creators of the training do not know anything about programming languages to create a course.

**3. It can be learned anytime, anywhere**
One of the great advantages of LMS platforms is the ease of learning it provides and its availability for the user to do it anytime, anywhere. In this way, the problem of geographical and temporal distances is eliminated.

In the case of enterprise training, using an LMS platform, it is not necessary to have all the personnel of a sector out of the office at the same time. Something that in face-to-face training would be too expensive for the company.

**4. Facilitates access to information**
The provision of information through interaction between teachers and students enables effective and up-to-date learning. It encourages students to seek new information and gives them the resources for this. <br> </br>

This type of LMS platform requires a subscription to use. The advantage of LMS SaaS platforms is that once you acquire the license, your only concern will be in the creation of the training course.
