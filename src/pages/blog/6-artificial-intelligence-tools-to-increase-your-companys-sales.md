<br>


- **Automation:**
<br>
<br>
Automation is one of the functions that characterize artificial intelligence and makes it an essential tool in business.
<br>
<br>
But how does it work? It manages the input and updating of CRM data. It also recognizes patterns between them to identify opportunities. Thus, it can define the chances of cross-selling and which potential customers are most likely to buy.

<br>
<br>

- **Sales funnel optimization**
<br>
<br>
Here AI makes magic.  One of the expert system's strengths is analyzing the sales funnel.  After the data analysis, it shows the information it collects in stages, indicating the conversion rate of each salesperson and at which funnel's phase there is a weakness, or where customers abandon the conversion process.
<br>
<br>
In this way, you can identify deficiencies and strengths in your sales strategy and look for immediate solutions that attack the problem from the root.
<br>
<br>

- **Identify buying patterns**
<br>
<br>
The data processing that we have already discussed previously also allows you to know the behavior and interests of your users. All of this is possible because artificial intelligence puts a magnifying glass on the people in contact with your sector of interest. Then, it learns about their choices to give accurate conclusions.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, the result of this is a treasure for companies: predictions. Because knowing the buying patterns of your potential customers will allow you to be there when they need you most. Being timely in such a competitive environment makes all the difference in the world.
