Continuing our previous posts of tools and techniques to **Validate your Idea**, here we present some less common ways to test your solution.

<title-2>Practices for validating your business idea</title-2>

<title-3>1. Infographics</title-3>

People love infographics. It is a graphic, simple, concise, didactic, an amazing way of transmitting deep information as a complete business concept or just the business idea. 

Infographics are drawings with the schematized information of the idea you're validating.

These draws have small pieces of texts too but images predominate. 

With this tool, you can simplify your offer and make it more attractive to your potential audience and give more value. 

This is a way to represent the idea, but if you want to get a kind of answer from the customers, you have to make public this composition may be in a landing page, by email, etc. 

Another way to use infographics for validating an idea is by organizing the results of other practices of validation. For example, as we mentioned on the Customer Journey Map. 
Infographics are a tool by itself but it is a useful complement to other practices for the validation of business ideas.

<title-3>2. Guest Post</title-3>

In case you didn't know, a guest post is a type of post that makes a person, a guest writer or blogger. That is, if you have a blogger friend or are going to have an ally, you can post on its blog as a guest. 

What information would you post? In this case, it can be any data related to your business idea, to your project, and even you can add a direct contact link to a landing page (which is another of the tools you can use to validate your idea), to an email address, a form, a survey, a comment box or any tool that allows you to know the opinion of the potential user, or simply explain in more detail about your business proposal. 

But what we can recommend is that you be very specific, so that the person at least makes the feedback of the guest post and your idea with enough information. 

All this data you collect, you can store in a database, in the cloud, and then study it to make conclusions about how valid is your idea, what you can improve or just change. 

**Don’t forget**: the blog in which you are going to write must be optimized must have some authority on the web, and we recommend you to be either a commercial ally or a brand that works with a user profile similar to yours. 

<title-3>3. Ads campaign directed to the landing page mentioned above</title-3>

[Ads Campaigns](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Planning-your-ads-campaign-on-10-steps/) will require a small investment, but if you are trying to validate an idea to start the business trying this can be very profitable. 

Suppose that you make an ad with the problem and the specific solution, and you direct this ad to your potential customers in a campaign with the segmentation that you need. 

And the call to action that you use is “More Information” and you make people go to your landing page, or complete a survey, or a form. And all of that information you store it in a database on the cloud. 

That would be a really nice way to validate your idea, and although you have to make an investment, you have the certainty that your target audience can have access to your ad, and if your proposal is good enough, you will get their approval or perhaps a suggestion from them. 

<title-3>4. If it already exists, search for reviews</title-3>

There are several platforms that have products or services and also give us the opportunity to make a review from our experience with the product or service offered, and even of the brand that is behind. 

All reviews and opinions that you can see on websites like Amazon, eBay, or any of these platforms are the best guides to know what people love, and what they don´t like. Which strategies work and which don´t. 

This is another method to compare your business idea with others and know if it would have success. You can even compare the reviews for two companies, two business ideas that were related and base yours with the strengths of each one. 

From now on, pay more attention to reviews of products and brands, not only for buying something, for validating your business idea too.   

<title-3>5. MVP</title-3>

We made a post before about this topic. [An MVP means a Minimum Viable Product.](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/minimum-viable-product/) If you offer a software solution this means that you will do a basic version of your product, the first, with the minimum resources needed (money, functionality), enough for transmitting your business idea, the main concept of your solution. 

This product has to be tested and shown to people, potential customers, that will interact with him and give their experience, make suggestions, bring their point of view, etc.

If this does not validate an idea, nothing else will be. This is the approval or denial of your solution. If it resolves completely and effectively the problem, if it is suitable for potential customers, or if it needs improvements, etc. 

This method of validation will also need investment and some efforts of you and your team because you must complete light and functional version of your product, but we think that the information you will gather with this it is worth the effort.

<title-3>6. Be as creative as you can </title-3>

You have contests in which the award is related to the solution you are going to offer with your business idea; make surveys by email or look for any resource, preferably innovative, to know the opinion of the people who are within the profile of your audience. 

With **these methods to validate a business idea**, we close all the options we offer you for now. 

With them, the chances of success increase. Choose the one that suits you best, and if the result is positive throw yourself into the world of entrepreneurship and sees how wonderful it is. Good luck!
