This is a third of the list of new proposals of Google for companies that want to earn money with advertisement or just publish ads in a market created by the huge company of information. **Google Ad Manager** is the last of the platform that was launched last year, and here, we'll see everything we need to know and start using this tool. 


<title-2>Google Ad Manager overview</title-2>

Google Ad Manager is a free platform designed to manage advertising of a website. Specifically, it is an integrated advertising management platform that was launched last July for Google. 

This platform allows you to monitor the progress of your ads and best of all, optimize them so you can earn more money. 

Google Ad Manager works as another real-time marketplace where advertising is bought and sold on the Google Display network. 

Here are incorporated functions of [DoubleClick for Publishers](https://www.google.com/dfp/) and [DoubleClick Ad Exchange](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//adexchange/AdExchangeOverview.pdf).

And the best thing about this platform is that all its benefits are the same, regardless of the medium through which the ads are displayed, which can be through applications and games for mobile phones, smart TVs, pages, and others. 

Google Ad Manager works very well in coordination with Google Ads. Actually, you can publish Google Ads ads on Ad Manager's publisher sites.

Its main goal and reason for being is monetization thanks to the optimization and the segmentation of your ads, which is another of the benefits of this Google Ad Manager marketing tool. 

<title-2>Here are the key elements of the Google Ad Manager network</title-2>

**1. Inventory**

That is the advertising space that is available for being sold. 

This element is composed of: 
* **Blocks of ads**, which are the spaces where ads can be made and can also have labels;
* **The positions**, which are a grouping of ad blocks; 
* And **the value keys**, which allow you to define custom search criteria.

**2. Publications**

That can be made once the entire inventory is in place. 

This second element has a start and end date. As well as the creative element, in terms of the resource, you are going to use. The video, the image, and the content that you are going to direct to the users.

**3. Users**

Another interesting thing about this tool is that it lets you know who is accessing your network, and keep track of this. 

In the same way, you know what they can see and how they can interact. That's what this element is all about. 

<title-2>Google Ad Manager allows you to do:</title-2>

* **Pay per click**

This is the essence of this platform. You will only have to pay for each click your ad receives from your target audience. 


* **Segment your ad**

In this way, they will be displayed only by people who might be interested in consuming your product or service. This is possible thanks to big data techniques, we mean, to the information that Google knows and manages to know the behavior, the interests and to construct the profile of each person. 

* **Have help to design your ad**

In the platform, there are some pre-designed templates of ads, so that you have an idea of how to make it or even personalize them using your creativity. 

Also, you can create your own template.


* **Have absolute control of your investment**

You can decide what your daily investment will be, how much you will pay per click, and change this information whenever you want. 

* **Organize ads**

According to the sections and pages that are part of the digital platform in which you are publishing. 

* **Have better control over results and progress**

Thanks to the reports of all the activities and the services of advertisements.

* **Take advantage of it at no cost**

Since the platform is free, you will be able to join and access all its functions without exception or cost. 

* **Publish your ad on Google Ads**

You only have to follow the [Google AdSense policies](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/48182?hl=es-419).

<title-3>Important! What is the difference between Google Ad manager and Google Marketing Platform?</title-3>

They are related, but they have their differences as well. Both were born as a Google proposal to expand advertising to various technological devices such as smart TVs, and also with the aim of simplifying the work and give new and more efficient proposals to its users.

**1. With Google Marketing Platform you can:**

Plan, buy, measure and optimize the purchase of digital media to analyze the results and activate audiences. 

**2. On the other hand, with Google Ad Manager you are in the possibility of:**

Deliver, measure, and optimize ads wherever the audience interacts. But basically, its goal is unified monetization on the same platform and the improvement of private markets and open sales.

**3. The tools that unified Google Marketing Platform are:**

* [Search 360.](https://support.google.com/searchads/answer/1187512?hl=en)
* [Analytics 360.](https://support.google.com/marketingplatform/answer/6292532?hl=en)
* [DoubleClick Campaign Manager.](https://www.jellyfish.net/en-es/doubleclick-certified-marketing-partner/doubleclick-campaign-manager)
* [DoubleClick Studio.](https://support.google.com/richmedia/answer/2389093?hl=en)
* [Data Studio.](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/)
* [Google Audience Center 360.](https://www.blastam.com/google-audience-center-360)
* [Optimize 360.](https://www.blastam.com/google-optimize-360)
* [Surveys 360.](https://www.periscopix.co.uk/analytics-360-suite/google-surveys-360/)
* [Tag Manager.](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/)

**4. While the platforms that integrated Google Ad Manager**

* [DoubleClick for Publishers](https://www.google.com/dfp/)
* [DoubleClick Ad Exchange.](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//adexchange/AdExchangeOverview.pdf)

It is basically a market of ads.

**5. Google ad manager has larger possible target platforms than Google Marketing Platform. Because in fact, this is one of its objectives, to give greater relevance and use to the content of this type in the lives of users. Even more than they already have. In fact, there are statistics that show that** [78% of monetization in digital advertising is due to this type of programmatic advertising. And this is only in our country.](https://www.kanlli.com/publicidad-programatica/google-marketing-platform-y-google-ad-manager/) Part of the innovation of Google Ad Manager is precisely this, the possibility of transmitting ads on mobile games, smart TVs, etc.

<title-3>In this way, Google Ad Manager and Google Ads work together</title-3>

Here's where Google explains [how these platforms work together](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2472739?hl=en) in the auction:

* "When a publisher offers inventory to Ad Exchange, Google Ads runs its own auction and composes the best ad unit -- with a full slot ad or a group of text ads. Google Ads will then calculate the appropriate Ad Exchange bid for the ad unit by taking the ads' bids and applying the Google Ads revenue share.
* This bid is compared with other Ad Exchange advertiser bids and any controls set by publishers, such as minimum CPMs. Bids that don't meet these publisher controls are ignored.
* Ad Exchange will then take all of the eligible bids and run an auction. If Google Ads wins the auction, the advertiser(s) in the winning ad unit will pay no more than what is required to rank higher than the next advertiser, on a CPC basis, when a user clicks on the ad or completes another valid event in connection with the ad. The publisher will be paid the higher of the second highest bid value in the Ad Exchange auction or the minimum CPM."

This was the missing tool from the list of three proposals that Google presents us to manage marketing campaigns and ads. Now, you're in a position to decide to use any of these tools. Which one will be the winner? Google Ads, Google Marketing Platform and **Google Ad Manager**, which is the protagonist of this post. When you decide and use them, tell us your experience. The goal is to monetize. Let's go!
