To be effective in your job as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Remote-work-team-productivity-how-to-manage-your-processes/">   software developer</a>, you need to be both personally and professionally ready to handle the challenges you will inevitably face. By following these steps, you’ll not only be prepared to meet new demands as they arise, but you’ll also be able to relax and enjoy yourself more along the way. Here are five steps to help make you a better software developer today and in the future.

This article will give you five steps to help you become a better <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   software developer</a>. Whether you’re working for yourself or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/what-a-Saas-company-is/">   a company</a>, these benefits can be leveraged to improve your lifestyle and productivity. This guide will show you how to become more efficient at writing code to work smarter, not harder! <br> </br>

<b><title-4>1. Don´t put your life on hold to be a productive developer</title-4></b>

It means that you must prioritize your time. 

You probably wake up every day intending to complete your office tasks - whether they are from home or, indeed, from an office, and once they are done, you dedicate time to your personal life. 

On the surface, this seems logical and quite productive, but it's not something that works in the long run. Being a productive developer doesn't mean you should work non-stop and spend even less than half of your day on work. 

You don't need to clutter your life with so much work when you can prioritize the activities you have pending.

You know as well as we do that there are crucial tasks that must be completed today, but there are also others that can be done tomorrow, others next week, and even others for the following month. 

Get into the habit of planning your activities and prioritizing them so that you can be a master of your time and dedicate more time to yourself. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>2. Avoid dispersion, and routine is your friend: developer lifestyle</title-4></b>

For everyone, it works differently.  It can vary between developers who work from 9 to 5 in an office and others who work remotely from home. 

In any case, it is essential to create and stick strictly to a routine that includes the quality time from you to you.

Activities that relax your body and mind will give you brain power that you can use to the fullest in your daily tasks. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>3. Be aware of burnout to be a productive developer everyday</title-4></b>

Being a software developer means spending hours writing code, which can easily lead to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/development-team-is-burned-out/">   burnout</a>.

Spending so many hours in front of the pc can be very tiring, to the point of losing the passion for programming and even the social interaction with friends and family members. 

If you're new, you'll probably love sitting around writing code to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/figma-all-you-can-do-to-design-cool-applications/">   see your creative work</a>, but eventually, the overwork will burn you out. The best thing to do is to balance work and personal life, ensuring you don't neglect other important things like hobbies, family, and friends. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>4. Easy to read and test</title-4></b>

Although sometimes it seems like an impossible task, you should try to write code that is easy to read and that makes testing easier. 

When you are a beginner, you are expected to write line after line of code to create a function, and this may seem fine at first, but eventually, it will be a headache. 

The idea is to make it as functional, readable, and reusable as possible. It is a crucial characteristic to be an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/top-pros-of-remote-software-developer-service/">   excellent software developer</a>. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>5. Understand that it's not just code; it's something much bigger</title-4></b>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/software-development-as-a-service-sdaas-how-to-succeed-without-permanent-staff/">   Being a software developer</a> means being part of something much bigger than just writing code to add features according to the client's or boss's requirements. 

We must understand the project's magnitude when creating functionalities in a digital platform and become as familiar as possible to understand the project's actual value. In this way, the level of commitment will increase and, therefore, your productivity and dedication to the project. <br> </br>

<b><title-2>Being a productive software developer and having a healthy lifestyle is possible</title-2></b>

Generally, we believe that being productive is about getting as much work done in as little time as possible. Still, it's really about prioritizing tasks and finding a balance between work and the only life we have to enjoy.

Follow these simple steps, and you will notice the difference between your enthusiasm for your work as a software developer and your enjoyment of your free time.
