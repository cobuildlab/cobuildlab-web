Miami, FL. Jun 06, 2022.

As time progresses, technological advances create a wave of technical demand, i.e., an endless cycle where the more significant the innovation, the greater the need. 

Since the pandemic, the work of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/software-development-as-a-service-sdaas-how-to-succeed-without-permanent-staff/">   software developers</a> - and, in fact, of all workers worldwide - has become remote. Still, this time we will focus only on what concerns us: remote software development. 

Many startups and entrepreneurs who begin to create and materialize ideas in the technological world go through many complications when putting together a team that is truly capable of fulfilling all the tasks necessary to develop the projects. In addition, the bill can go through the roof when hiring permanent staff in terms of administrative costs. 

So what is the solution to save money, ensure quality, professionalism, and dedication, and avoid overcrowding? <b>Hiring remote software developers.</b>

<title-2 align="centered">Hiring what you need, when you need it, and for the time you need it.</title-2>.

They are called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/hire-remote-software-developers/">   remote software developers</a>, and these are the pros of having them on your team. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>World-class talent:</title-4></b>

One of the most significant advantages of considering a remote <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/aspects-to-measure-performance-software-product/">   software</a> developer is having access to highly trained and referenced professionals worldwide. Since geography is no longer a barrier, there are no limitations -beyond language- that prevent obtaining a human resource that meets the required capabilities. In addition, there is the advantage of hiring renowned developers so that their references can honestly speak for them. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>Cost-effective:</title-4></b>

It's not all about money, but any money saved can make a difference for a start-up or a small or medium-sized business. Also, when we talk about saving, it does not necessarily mean that the quality of something, in particular, will be lowered. It is the opposite; processes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/upgrade-the-software-tool-you-are-using-for-business-activities/">   would be optimized</a>, and costs would be reduced, but how does this happen?

When you hire a remote developer, you are not paying for all their time or knowledge. Generally, when we talk about web and mobile platform development, projects require specific skills, time, dedication, etc. By hiring a remote developer, you only pay for the tasks you need, per project, or as best suits your needs.

For example, here at Cobuild Lab, we take care of recruiting the best developers to meet high-quality standards and assign them to the projects that require them for specific times and previously defined tasks. Knowing that you are just starting out or that your company still belongs to the small or medium-size category, we ensure that your financial resources are used optimally. <br> </br>

<b><title-4>Easy integration:</title-4></b>

Being in an office may be ideal for some people, but integrating new team members does not always happen ideally. Between training, presentations, compliance, etc., it can take time for a person to show their true potential after truly adapting to their work environment. 

When done correctly and efficiently, the combined efforts between the staffing firm and your staffing company can be seamless and bring significant benefits such as time savings, increased efficiency, and collaboration with the in-house team. 

All this is solved by hiring a remote developer. It's a fact the worker's productivity increases more when they do not feel the pressure of looking over the shoulder of the boss and other complications -which have been normalized- mentioned above.

The perfect team does exist, and you just need to look for the right people in the right places who are truly capable of fulfilling the required tasks and who are adaptable to the culture of the team you will be working with remotely.

<b><title-4>Bye-bye, employer management problems:</title-4></b>

Hiring a remote developer avoids the costs and responsibilities of employing someone permanently.

Entrepreneurship can have exponential growth, sometimes somewhat challenging to control correctly due to the economic and bureaucratic factors, so remote hiring is an option that perfectly fits the needs of this type of company.

The headaches and waste of money searching, interviewing, recruiting, and training new staff are passed. At Cobuild Lab, we take care of recruiting the perfect developer for the project, from the evaluation of their skills and other determining factors such as location, language, work habits, and more to consider when searching.

Expanding the workforce will always be necessary for one reason or another. Still, the important thing is to know that developers don't necessarily have to become permanent team members. Still, there is the possibility of hiring highly trained talent to fulfill particular web or mobile projects.
