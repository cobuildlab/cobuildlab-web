<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/workflows-in-your-business/"> Workflow</a> automation and robotic process automation (RPA) are two tools for automating business processes. They’re essential tools in a very dynamic economic landscape such as our own, and you must always be at the forefront of technology, to stay competitive in a tight market. 

Every day that passes, these tools and technologies are climbing in the market, and more companies request them, especially in logistics, a sector that faced massive changes  during the pandemic. 

Here, we introduce you to both (RPA and workflow automation), so you can choose the most affordable one according to your needs or even discover the way they would operate inside your company.

<br>

<title-2>Let’s define Workflow Automation</title-2>

<br>

Workflow automation refers to the design, execution, and automation of processes using technology to streamline and connect tasks. 

Rather than automating individual components of a task, workflow automation automates the flow of tasks between work activities. Processes are based on workflow rules in which human tasks, data, or files are connected between people or systems based on predefined rules. 

This streamlines many of the tasks within the company, and improves the productivity and efficiency of the company significantly, greatly decreasing the workload.

<title-2>Next, the meaning of RPA</title-2>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/top-benefits-of-robotic-process-automation-in-logistics/"> Robotic Process Automation </a> (RPA) allows automating repetitive tasks without the intervention of a person. This type of tool emulates the actions of a person interacting with an application to fulfill an objective. 

Many tasks can be automated, such as loading information into an application, processing an email, and performing complex calculations, among others. It is commonly used in business areas such as administration, supplies, finances, etc. 

The purpose in itself is to optimize the performance of a process, automating repetitive tasks, improving execution times, and reducing the error rate.

<title-3>Similarities and differences between RPA & Workflow Automation</title-3>

<br>

**Some of the differences include:**

* The workflow automation defines generic workflows. On the other hand, the RPA is used to define very specific workflows.

* RPA seeks to replace human tasks. The other seeks to involve people in the processes.

* In workflow automation, the return is not immediate while in RPA an immediate return is generated.

* RPA seeks to automate tasks, and Workflow automation seeks to automate at the corporate level.  

**Some of their similarities and advantages include:**

* Reduced approval cycles
* Reduced manual handling
* Improved visibility
* Improved employee satisfaction
* Continual process improvement
* Better workload management
* Reduced errors

It is important to highlight that although they seem like different terms, the reality is that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/robotic-process-automation/"> RPA </a> and Workflow automation are two fundamental elements of digital transformation and are developed together to achieve effective results in any business.

<br>

<title-3>How can both solutions work together within your company?</title-3>

<br>

The best way these tools work as one is by understanding the reach they have.

For example, we know that workflow automation helps us in general processes such as automated decision making, tasks and activities distribution, and communication channels.

On the other hand, RPAs help us to carry out more specific and repetitive tasks that seek to reduce human labor and errors. 

Your workflow automation tool can assign RPAs to different tasks within the company, taking into account several variants such as functionality, workload, and response time.

All companies have a common goal: to improve sales and profitability. During the execution of business processes, many activities, such as sending personalized emails or following up with your potential leads, require repeating a task several times. You can program and RPA to do it, but the management and follow-up can be made through workflow automation and human resources. 

Achieving different goals at the right time can be difficult, especially when it comes to tasks handled manually by employees. That’s when Workflow Automation and RPAs come to the rescue. The first in general, and the last in specific activities.

So, maybe it's time to introduce **RPA, workflow automation**, or both within your company so you can get quantifiable results and grow your business.
