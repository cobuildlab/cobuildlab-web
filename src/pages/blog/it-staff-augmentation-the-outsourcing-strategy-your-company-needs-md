The term Staff Augmentation is currently in vogue, probably due to the IT industry trend of trying to reduce costs and improve the operational efficiency of projects, which is why they resort to this type of strategy.  However, the real benefits of this form of augmenting a team of collaborators in an agile and flexible way are not always measured, which is why we are going to dive into this topic in a clear, simple, and concise approach.  <br> </br>

<title-3 align="centered"> First things first, what is Staff Augmentation? </title-3> <br> </br>

In this age of Digital Transformation, we are facing a business landscape that is quite tough and demanding on companies as it is expected of them to have enough flexibility to launch new products, services, and functionalities at a very fast pace. This situation has put immense pressure on their IT departments, which have to develop their software in a rush to keep up with the pace of new releases. On top of that, some of these developments may involve more up-to-date or disruptive technologies, which makes everything even more complicated given the current global shortage of talent. In this context, the Staff Augmentation strategy becomes a lifeline for several companies. <br> </br>

Staff Augmentation is an outsourcing strategy that has been in the market for some years now and allows companies to recruit technical talent from around the world, choosing the candidates that best fit their requirements and placing them on their own teams when they are needed to perform specific functions on a temporary basis, thus allowing companies to meet their set goals.  <br> </br>

This staffing method is designed to complement an existing team with skilled technical resources to perform a variety of tasks such as programming apps or hybrid applications, improving the company's capabilities, occupying a very specific position, or filling the gap left by a member who is on leave. <br> </br>


<title-3 align="centered"> The outsourcing strategy implemented by companies  </title-3> <br> </br>

This is a high-control strategy, as the staff that is recruited is employed directly by the supplier who in effect acts as a strategic partner; this is an excellent method of saving resources, and here's why: <br> </br>

‚ñ™Ô∏è As an employer, using Staff Augmentation strategies avoids both the cost and the responsibility of new full-time hires. <br> </br>

‚ñ™Ô∏è Staff Augmentation is based on a very favorable principle for the hiring company and is that the employer should only pay the professional for the time worked, a fact that would definitely have a positive impact on the company's salary statements.   <br> </br>

‚ñ™Ô∏è By hiring developers remotely, the cost of office space, facilities, workstations, transportation, among other things, is saved. <br> </br>

‚ñ™Ô∏è On the other hand, the IT partner is responsible for both recruiting and training staff, so the company that hires a Staff Augmentation service only has to simply pay the established fee and that's it! They don't need to take care of anything else except growing their business. <br> </br>

When a company decides to acquire an IT Staff Augmentation service, it incorporates experienced software engineers into an existing team in order to push a project forward, and in that way, the work is done internally and the company can have full control of the project. <br> </br>
