It doesn’t matter if we are still in a pandemic or not, Artificial Intelligence keeps growing at a very fast pace and it has impacted every industry with its applications. AI is considered an intriguing domain because it assures transformational changes in every industry across the Earth.

<br>

Constant applicability of Artificial Intelligence is guaranteed because it can create disruptive technologies, cognitive capabilities and new abilities and attributes for any business that adopts AI.

<br>

Moreover, AI has become an amazing tool for companies to accomplish objectives, make crucial choices, and develop new products and services; it has also helped numerous businesses to achieve success as a consulting service. With AI and Machine Learning the way that industries operate will never be the same.

<br>

If you’ve been capable of seeing how much fulfillment has been made based on Artificial Intelligence from 2019 and 2021, imagine what 2022 has to offer for business leaders.

<br>

<title-2>Check out the 5 greatest Artificial Intelligence (AI) trends for 2022:</title-2>

<br>

<title-2>1. AI-augmented automation</title-2>

<br>

The importance of information technology is more focused on delivering business value. The intersection and overlap of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence can give life to AI-augmented automation. AI-augmented automation means the outcome of combining human and machine intelligence, which means the use of Artificial Intelligence in real life situations. The reasons to apply AI-augmented automation is to reduce eros and quirks based on models, biases and interpretation. Also, empathy and trust is added because it would develop empathic systems. And most important, ROI is the king, using AI augmented the Return Of Investment will increase due to productivity and efficiency.

<title-2>2. The perfect match of AI + Cloud Integration</title-2>

<br>

Artificial Intelligence is almost essential in the wide adoption of Cloud Solutions in the upcoming year, with this, users will be able to watch and control cloud resources and even gain access to a great data set. AI can use Machine Learning to optimize data and even increase the cloud abilities. This is a win-win situation because cloud computing systems will improve AI systems, and AI will provide help to automate data and tasks to a better analysis outcome without even needing human intervention.

<br>

<title-2>3. More sustainability in companies</title-2>

<br>

Governments and businesses have the option to choose Artificial Intelligence to decrease and reduce the dependence over fossil fuels; stand up against deforestation; and avoid CO2 emissions. There is not a wide variety of green AI innovation, however several AI deployments are assisting businesses to accomplish sustainable goals. For example, IBM is using its artificial intelligence expertise to improve weather forecasting and renewable energy predictions.

<title-2>4. Cyber security + Artificial Intelligence</title-2>

<br>

AI will help companies enter a new dimension of cybersecurity because technologies are constantly evolving, which means that many enterprises are weaker and more vulnerable to security threats. Machine Learning provides statistics and insights about the security ruptures and gaps so risk management initiatives are more punctual and detailed without having to spend lots of time trying to figure out what the problem is.

<br>

Artificial Intelligence analyzes network traffic and learns to acknowledge samples and patterns that can mean criminal intentions. This is one of the most significant applications of AI.

<br>

<title-2>5. Business forecasting and analysis</title-2>

<br>

Considering hundreds of matrices with the use of ML and Artificial Intelligence with the objective of generating more accurate predictions and forecasts. “Fintech businesses, for example, are using AI to anticipate demand for multiple currencies in real-time based on market circumstances and customer behavior. It aids Fintech firms in having the correct quantity of supply to satisfy demand.” - Analytics Insight

<br>

There’s a new generation of Artificial Intelligence technologies that have provided a promise in helping to improve how the forecasting process is developed, including applications such as product demand, cash flow, employee turnover, manpower forecasting, inventory management, etc.

<br>

Forecasting approaches can be divided into two characteristics. Time series, which means that the future will tend to look and behave like the past. Relational, which means that the future depends on the direction of a variety of factors.
