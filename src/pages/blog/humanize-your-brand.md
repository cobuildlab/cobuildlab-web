<title-3>3. Share all content that your clients generate</title-3>

When we say all content, we mean to the whole content related to your brand. Experiences that will make more human and authentic your brand.

It is more than a review. It could be a comment on your website, a publication in their social media account, and every publication they make about their experience using your product or before enjoy your service. 

Even you can share comments or private chats where they are thanking you or making a good comment. 

A good place for sharing this is the stories in social media platform. Potential customers will see these experiences and they will be attracted to have your product or service to feel the same. 

“What your user says is the best publicity for every brand in the world.”

Is not necessary that the information you bring has been about the work. It could be about their life. But don’t get confused. It is necessary that you tell the employees’ story related to their work and your brand. 

The employee of the month, a story about what makes that staffer so great, and that is the kind of content that your client would love in your website and social media account.

<title-3>5. Shows a funny side of your brand</title-3>

Some laughs always are good and when it's about relationships between brands and customers it is good too. 

Scientists from urku PET Centre, Oxford and Aalto universities discovered that when people have social laugh leads to an endorphin release in the brain and that helps to establish social bonds. So, if laugh improves social connections you can take advantage of them and use them in favor to your brand. 

You don’t have to be a comedian, with share popular, viral, and funny content is enough. 

But remember, this funny content should be related to your product or service. At least with a characteristic of your brand. 

This is a good example of this.
