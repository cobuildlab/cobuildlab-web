<title-2>Why is software customization a better solution in logistics for e-commerce?</title-2>

<br>

The customization of your logistics and supply chain software through software development is one of the smartest strategies that you can carry out. 

* It allows being more productive, and efficient since the software can be tailored to your processes allowing consumers to receive better service. 
* Similarly, customizing your logistics software allows you to understand the behavior of your customers and offer an inventory that meets the needs of consumers, avoiding overstocking in your warehouse. You can do this by conducting surveys, observing what your competitors offer, performing A/B tests, and studying your sales trends. 
* Another important customization aspect of this software is its scalability because through ERP you can add or remove tools and have all the tools you want in a single software. Thus, you can reduce the loss of information and eliminate the garbage that can generate each of the logistics processes.
