The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/iot-development/"> Internet of Things </a> (IoT) is revolutionizing processes and operations in Warehouse Management and the Supply Chain. There are time-consuming tasks related to stocking and managing products that don’t allow productivity expectations to be met, and IoT helps improve and evolve the way these tasks are developed.

<br>

<title-2>What's the Internet of Things?</title-2>

<br>

IoT is a system of devices connected with the internet that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies. It has the ability to transfer data using a network without the manipulation of humans, or even human-to-computer interaction. 

Endless possibilities for people and companies have come to life with IoT implementation. Some examples of IoT are smart home devices, such as lightning, air conditioning, and security systems;  remote health monitoring and emergency notification systems in the healthcare industry; inventory management, warehouse management, and more in the logistics industry.

<br>

<title-2>Importance of IoT for the logistics industry</title-2>

<br>

IoT has become essential for business owners since it provides real-time data and information, delivering insights and statistics about the performance of supply chain and logistics operations.

The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/iot-development/">  Internet of Things </a> allows the automation of processes in companies and reduces labor costs. Moreover, IoT reduces wastes and improves delivery management, decreasing the costs to manufacture and deliver goods, additionally, it offers transparency for customer transactions.

IoT is one of the most relevant technologies nowadays, and it will continue to rise as businesses notice its importance to keep ahead of the competition.

<title-2>How the Internet of Things is impacting <a target="_blank" href="aqui va el link">  Warehouse Management </a></title-2>

<br>

<title-3>1. Introduction of “smart” warehouse management</title-3>

<br>

IoT devices can help reduce errors, manual labor, increasing processing speeds, and overall warehouse efficiency. IoT sensors are being used to monitor and follow up the movement of materials and other assets in their facilities. The usage of these sensors in shelves is important to track and transmit real-time inventory data.

The Internet of Things assists warehouse management to reduce expensive and time-consuming errors guaranteeing inventory levels and equipment locations to be known and monitored.

<br>

<title-3>2. Warehouse management solutions</title-3>

<br>

IoT devices help warehouse management with the location, packing, transportation data, and shipment in real-time. What’s the best about this? You won’t lose track of the assets because these are constantly updated, and this can also be applied to human assets, knowing the personnel position in real-time.

<br>

<title-3>3. Smart inventory management</title-3>

<br>

With the Internet of Things devices, equipment for a more intelligent warehouse is possible, using shelf sensors allows people to find and manage the inventory, and even more possible to take preventative actions in case an emergency is presented as a notification when an item is out of stock. IoT warehouse management devices asset warehouse managers to transport or return cargo.

<br>

<title-3>4. Reduction in labor costs</title-3>

<br>

IoT allows the evolution of automation for warehouse management that permits automated guided vehicles or even material handling robots. Manual intervention is no longer needed, only in specific tasks, and this is actually revolutionizing the operations in a warehouse.

How IoT is revolutionizing warehouses? Using robots and automated forklifts are being implemented too, and they can be remotely commanded to transport an asset from one location to another. 

What is the impact of this? More productivity, fewer costs, more efficiency, and objectives are being met in a specific date range before expected.

<br>

<title-3>5. Optimal use of space in warehouses</title-3>

<br>

The Internet of Things helps warehouse managers to utilize the space in the facilities to distribute and organize goods efficiently. With a Warehouse Management System and IoT devices, it will help calculate the free space in a facility based on the entry and exit of goods.

<br>

<title-3>6. Maintenance of goods in a facility</title-3>

<br>

Environmental factors are essential for maintaining the quality of food. Cold storage enhances the life and freshness for a long time of certain products. With IoT, temperature sensors could go in the cold storage so the temperature can be monitored at all times. 

This also means evolution for the food industry because it will preserve the quality of food items.

<br>

<title-3>7. Visibility and transparency in the supply chain industry</title-3>

<br>

Adequate support systems for warehouses can help them gain comprehensive information about the markets’ supply and demand. With the Internet of Things and its advanced insights and analytics, the visualization of operations to improve the logistics cycle based on the market status is possible.

<br>

<title-3>8. Inventory management optimization</title-3>

<br>

Complete data analytics in a warehouse can help develop strategic plans with IoT warehouse solutions. All actions, all data, can be monitored, and even forecasted what is required to schedule and inventory. What will this do? Optimize the warehouse space.

<br>

<title-3>9. Automation</title-3>

<br>

IoT can follow up with shipping and service tracking. This means that a warehouse company does not need inventory managers or other experts, avoiding spending long hours manually monitoring and reporting authorities. With the Internet of Things monitoring all products and the results will immediately be recorded in large data units or warehouses.

<br>

<title-2>What is the conclusion?</title-2>

<br>

Implementation of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/iot-development/">  IoT in warehouse management </a> can be positive for any company improving the speed and accuracy of operations.
