It doesn\'t matter if you are building your first product or your
fifteenth. It is essential to remember that new products will require
significant resources and tech investments. You can outsource the
development of your following tech product to a third-party agency to
ensure it\'s worth every penny and is built on solid foundations.

<title-3>What Is a Product Developer?</title-3>

A product developer is an engineer/industrial designer ([a variation of
product development](https://www.synapse.com/)) who creates
products for small and large companies. This career involves working
with clients to understand their needs and research market
opportunities. They analyze trends to determine which products are
popular. This data is used to create an attractive design.

Product developers\' job duties may include designing prototypes,
translating sketches into specification sheets, using computer design
software, and collaborating to launch products with sales, technical,
marketing, and manufacturing departments. Product developers combine
design and engineering skills to develop better outcomes than others in
the marketplace.

<title-3>Reasons to hire a Product Development Specialist.</title-3>

Below we will outline why you should hire a product development
specialist. This list should cover any concerns you may have and help
you develop your business following a [circular
economy](https://www.rts.com/resources/guides/circular-economy/).

<title-4>They Create Better Development Processes</title-4>

The first phase of development for most companies is chaotic. With the
launch date only months away, developers are surviving on coffee and
stress. Every fire you extinguish brings another roaring to life. One
thing that will keep your team focused is a solid process based on
identifying core interactions that are valuable to end users.

We see the most common mistake companies make to get land locked into
feature sets without asking whether those features are needed for the
core product to work. It is essential to know the goal of any product\'s
first version. It should solve a problem in a better way than it
currently is.

When that requirement has been met, then the product must be released.
Market feedback can help you determine how to improve it. Your customer
base will not accept the best solution if it is kept in a lab.

This can be a tricky one. It\'s not a good idea to bring a half-baked
product on the market and then have it fail because it isn\'t enough of
an improvement to existing products. Product developers prototype with
customers and then test it. They always strive to find the point at
which the progress over the existing solution outweighs the
inconvenience of switching to a different explanation for the end-user.

<title-4>Spotting Company Weaknesses</title-4>

If your company can\'t adapt, it will be overwhelmed by the competition.
Look at how fluid the Fortune 500 has been over the past few years.
Consultants can spot weaknesses and help develop a plan.

<title-4>You Save On Recruitment Costs</title-4>

Recruitment is an energy-intensive and time-consuming task. It takes
energy away from other studies. Even if your skills are necessary, you
will pay a lot if you can\'t meet your needs.

A product development specialist will help you achieve your goals at a
fraction of the cost. You don\'t have to hire all the people, which
allows you to cut recruitment costs and save big.

These are just a few reasons to hire a product design agency. They know
more than just coding. They also can communicate with all functions and
remove any constraints.

<title-4>They Test New, Profitable Ideas</title-4>

Product developers maintain and improve existing projects. They are paid
to bring products to market. Imagine a third-party dedicated to testing
your ideas and evaluating them. Product Development agencies can help.

After giving the software and technology components to the experts, it
is time to return them to the internal team. They will examine your idea
without bias, run rapid tests and find the potential pitfalls. They can
identify metrics and provide signals to help ensure things run smoothly.

Third-party product specialists can look at an idea, quickly prototype
it and test it to determine whether it\'s an intelligent use of company
funds. A prototyped product idea can be a great success.

A product specialist can re-prototype an idea or close it down if they
aren\'t held responsible for the product\'s efficiency. The loss will be
capped at a fraction of the original cost. Although \$100,000 might seem
expensive, this is still a fraction of the cost of product development
that many companies waste yearly due to lackluster prototyping and
screening.

<title-4>Building a Skilled Team Without Interrupting Development</title-4>

The pace of technology is rapid, particularly with the rise of the
[Internet of
Things](https://www.oracle.com/ae/internet-of-things/what-is-iot/).
No company can afford not to innovate while others in the market are
doing the same. While constantly innovating, you must frequently find
and develop talent to support these efforts.

What does a product owner do? Product consultants can be an excellent
resource for product owners. They can start projects and help you find
external candidates to strengthen your team. It isn\'t easy to build the
right team.

<title-4>Forecasting the Future</title-4>

Preparing for the future can seem complicated. While there is always an
immediate problem to resolve or a brand-new fire to put out - the fact
is: Your organization is falling back if it isn\'t prepared for what\'s
next. In short, your company must look like Google.

It must master the moon shot. Google sets its panoramas far ahead and
innovates in places where others would say, \"No way.\" However, this is
not always the end. It\'s often the product challenges that Google
solves while innovating. Product professionals live in an uncertain
future, just like Google.

<title-3>Conclusion</title-3>

[Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/189788/global-outsourcing-market-size/)
reported that the global market size for outsourced services is clocking
at 100 billion US dollars, and the numbers continue to grow. More
businesses are delegating some sections of their operations to
third-party vendors. It makes outsourcing product development experts a
common practice for most industries.

Moreover, giant firms such as WhatsApp, Opera, and Skype have
successfully outsourced product development consultancy that brought
immense success. So, to conclude, it is incredibly beneficial to hire a
product development specialist.
