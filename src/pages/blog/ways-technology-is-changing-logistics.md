The logistics industry is becoming increasingly affected by technology. Companies are constantly updating their processes to stay competitive and meet changing customer expectations. Various advances in technology have allowed for greater efficiency, scalability, and transparency in the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Supply-chain-synchronization/">  supply chain </a>, which allows businesses to optimize their workflow but also means that customers expect more from the service. These advancements mean that the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-using-a-cloud-logistics-solution/"> logistics industry</a> is also increasing in size and scale, and workers need to be upskilled to keep up with the changes. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.monarch.edu.au/courses/transport-logistics/">  Monarch’s logistics course</a> can provide you with the education you need if you’re looking to find work in the industry.

<br>

<title-2>Increased Transparency</title-2>

<br>

Transparency within the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Tips-for-Managing-the-Supply-Chain-after-a-Pandemic/"> supply chain industry has improved significantly in recent years</a>, mainly due to the introduction of real-time data analysis. The ability to track your order and access this information across multiple platforms has given consumers more confidence when ordering a product or service online or over the phone, reducing the need to shop in-store. This increased visibility in the shipping process has helped logistics companies manage and streamline their services but has also increased customer demand for convenient services.

Because technology has improved a company’s ability to provide accurate information and timelines to their customers, this also puts more pressure on the process. Customers expect to be informed of any issues or delays and are likely to complain if they don’t get their products on time.

<br>

<title-2>Greater Efficiency</title-2>

<br>

There are several advancements in technology that have allowed for greater efficiency in logistics processes. Firstly, multiple aspects of the supply chain are now able to be consolidated in one place - like inventory, forecasting, and shipment dates. Many intuitive programs will be able to update multiple platforms at once, which streamlines inventory management and reduces the potential for error.

Additionally, smart technologies like autonomous vehicles and 3D printing have begun to revolutionize the production and distribution process. 3D printing is already quite widely available, allowing for complex designs to be more efficiently and cost-effectively produced. Autonomous vehicles are being used by some large manufacturers, like Amazon and Tesla, but are not quite ready for mass production yet.

<br>

<title-2>Improved Connectivity</title-2>

<br>

Technology has advanced at such a rate that most of us will rarely be found without our mobile phones. We are constantly connected, and companies have had to keep up with this by providing information to their customers through multiple services and platforms. 

Additionally, physical barriers have become less of a problem because of advancements in technology. Having access to manufacturers around the world (due to improved communication and faster <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Transport-Tech-moving-people-around-the-world/">  transport </a>) means that companies are now able to acquire a larger variety of parts and materials, which has the potential to improve the quality of their products. 

<br>

<title-2>Increased Security</title-2>

<br>

The increase in data capabilities and machine learning reduces the need for sensitive information to be exposed or related to other workers along the supply chain. This increases consumer confidence and allows companies to provide guarantees that their information will be safe.

<br>

<title-2>Workflow Optimization</title-2>

<br>

Technologies like the internet of things (<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/internet-of-things-promises-2019/">  IoT </a>) and artificial intelligence (<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/How-artificial-intelligence-impacts-your-business-supply-chain/">   AI </a>) have increased workflow optimization in the logistics industry. AI can understand and input data rapidly and accurately, which reduces the risk of human error, minimizes delays, and improves quality control. The internet of things has increased connectivity and allowed information to be communicated to different aspects of the supply chain at the same time.

Radiofrequency identification (RFID) has also enhanced workflow optimization and provided opportunities for greater scalability. <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/RFID-for-Warehouse-and-Inventory/">  RFID chips </a> are used like wireless barcodes to track products, containers, trucks, and ships and provide real-time information to the company. This technology can scan multiple items at once, and removes the need for someone to manually scan products in and out.

<br>

<title-2>Better Safety Features</title-2>

<br>

Advancements in technology have also enabled companies to provide their employees with better safety measures. For example, the software can be used to track driver behavior and alert freight companies when their employees may be too tired to drive safely.

<br>

<title-2>Greater Predictive Capabilities</title-2>

<br>

Smart routing and predictive analytics have played a major role in streamlining the logistics industry. Smart routing allows delivery drivers to reorganize their routes in real-time to avoid delays and reduce petrol costs.

Predictive analytics has benefits for some points on the supply chain. Forecasting has improved, providing businesses with less waste or excess stock and allowing them to more readily meet customer demand. Predictive analytics can also be used to remotely analyze vehicles and issue warnings when maintenance is required. These capabilities have the potential to both reduce costs and increase the reliability of logistics services.
