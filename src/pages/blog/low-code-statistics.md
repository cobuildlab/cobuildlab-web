In the last few years, the world of software development has undergone great changes very fast. For all companies, it is well known that having customized and personalized software generates more efficiency and productivity. Some of these companies could not afford to pay for this custom development because it was not within their reach and they needed to reduce costs. But this has changed thanks to Low code, a technology that has allowed many companies to develop their applications and software without any problem. But this is not the only benefit, next we will show you some trends of the Low code market and how it is expected to evolve.

<br>

<title-2>Some important statistics of the Low code market and development</title-2>

<br>

* The global market for low-code development platforms is expected to generate revenues of $187 billion by 2030 and is expected to advance at a rapid pace.

* By 2024, 75% of large enterprises will use at least four low-code development tools for both software application development and citizen development initiatives.

* “Ease of use” is the most used (20%) positive word describing low code / no-code development platforms based on data collected from customer reviews for all low code / no-code development platforms companies.

* Low-code solutions have the potential to reduce development time by 90%.  Thus reducing costs.

* 71% of organizations leveraging citizen development have accelerated application development by at least 50% and 29% of companies have seen a 2x or greater jump in delivery time.

* Typically 90% of developers using a low-code platform have less than five application requests per month in the backlog. 

* 70% of low code users who had no experience before using low code platforms learned to do so in one month or less.  Opening up possibilities for newcomers.

* The demand for enterprise applications continues to grow - more than 500 million applications will be created by 2023. That is more than in the previous 40 years combined.

* Enterprise Companies Want More Citizen Developers, Most Enterprises (70%) will have policies in place for citizen developers, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/citizen-developers-are-ready-to-fill-the-gaps-in-enterprise-applications/">  according to Gartner’s Citizen Development is Fundamental to the Digital Workplace report </a>. This is because it is often cheaper to train employees in low code platforms than it is to expand IT departments and resources.

* Low-code is low risk and high reward. Process improvement and optimization are often the key focus areas for low-code development. Automation and integration tend to produce a quick return on investment, making low-code an attractive platform for both small and large enterprises.

These are some of the benefits that demonstrate why more and more companies are adopting this technology to develop their software:

* **Speed of development**:  Thanks to its drag-and-drop functionality, it allows these developments to be very fast, just by assembling previously existing functions that do not have any type of error. It can also work with pre-built user interfaces and models for business processes, which makes logic and data models easier, for the rapid development of cross-platform applications.

* **Decreased Costs**:  By being able to create more applications in less time, costs decrease. But that's not the only factor. Low-code development reduces the need for more developers, reducing hiring costs. In addition, the right low-code platform can make everyone in the organization, not just IT, more productive.

* **Faster Transformation**: In today's digital world, transformation is a  necessity. Low-code development takes the complexity out of creating modern enterprise applications. Thanks to these low-code advantages, organizations are better equipped to adapt and respond quickly to changing business conditions.

* **Better Customer Experience**: Low Code allows companies to develop applications and software that are even more personalized and more tailored to you and your customers, which improves service and fosters brand loyalty.  All with a better customer experience.

* **Higher Productivity**: By streamlining the development process and increasing the use of automation, IT can accomplish more in less time. In addition, low-code applications include tools that simplify the process lifecycle. This can include monitoring and alerting capabilities that notify staff when a process is at risk of failure. All of this improves our productivity as a team and as a company.
