Technology companies envision a self-managed, <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/staff-augmentation-vs-dedicated-team/">   dedicated technical team </a> when they plan to build their following big product. 

Building a successful development team is often not as easy as it sounds. What differentiates a good software developer from an excellent one is team members who are confident in achieving common goals.

Typically, development projects fail early due to a lack of collective and individual confidence in the project's success. Up to 78% of IT professionals feel uncoordinated with project requirements. 

In this article, you'll learn strategies and best practices for **building a software development team**, from finding the right people to project management techniques. We invite you to read on.

<title-2>What Is a Software Development Team?</title-2>

<br>

Software development teams work together to build a technical <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   project or product </a>. Every person on the development team plays a part in making this happen and should be held accountable for their work.

Most importantly, software development teams should be self-organizing and cross-functional. Structured and efficient work at an individual level optimizes the overall effectiveness of the development team.

At the same time, team members must make a collaborative effort when it comes to communicating and implementing shared responsibilities.

<title-2>Steps to build a successful software team</title-2>

<br>

* **Take Control of the Hiring Process:** If you take charge of the recruitment process, you can ensure that you target suitable candidates to apply for the position.   

You should always define the job, not the skills for the job; this helps you know the targets rather than having a long list of field-<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/soft-skills-every-developer-must-have/">   specific skills </a> and experiences, which increases the likelihood that you will tap more efficiently into talent pools.   

Another essential aspect of this first stage is to post ads that drive away passive candidates; this method will reduce the number of applicants between those who are simply interested and those who are genuinely qualified.

* **Hire People Who Are Passionate About Their Work:** Find developers who code their projects and have passionate projects just for fun. 

Having passionate developers is an excellent advantage for your team. They will deliver more than you ask for, encourage new ideas, and contribute to teamwork, which is why it is so important. Whenever you get one, try to make him part of your team, and he will undoubtedly be one of the best.

* **Evaluate and Cultivate Soft Skills:** Believe it or not, it is often the soft skills, in turn to the technical skills, that define the success of your software development team. A well-developed project requires more than just programming but a communicative and respectful team.

It will help if you are looking for soft skills and cultural fit during the hiring process. Emotional intelligence is key to a collaborative project.

* **Provide Tools and a Good Work Environment for Your Team:** To create a good software development team, you must ensure you provide them with everything they need to accomplish their task effectively. Includes a conducive working environment and all the necessary tools to enhance the team's creativity.

While your software development team is responsible for utilizing their soft skills in the workspace, you are responsible for making the workspace comfortable in the first place. 

Neglecting your software development <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/exercises-to-promote-the-mental-health-of-your-remote-developers-team/">   team's livelihood and mental health </a> could lead to rampant burnout and large amounts of stress. 

Extend tools and resources to your team, be it technology, to help them grow bigger and faster without frustrations or mental health referrals.

* **Make an effort to improve team communication:** <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/improve-communications-to-increase-team-productivity-by-developing-custom-software/">   Effective team communication </a> in the workplace cannot be lost. Your team must understand the importance of team communication because it is essential to your success.  

Communication can improve organizational effectiveness. When employees understand work rules, they will be more willing to ask for help when needed, and the team will be more capable. Strong team communication will create understanding, and understanding will build strong relationships within the group.

Effective communication within the team will establish common goals among team members to achieve their goals. Frequent communication can help team members sense belonging and strengthen interpersonal relationships.

* **Hold teams accountable:** The more capable your team is, the more <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/software-team-lead-roles-and-responsibilities/">   responsible </a> they will be for their tasks. Therefore, you should strive to allow your team to explain their duties and how they perform them.

Create an avenue that allows the team to share thoughts and opinions that can bring improvements to projects. In addition, ensuring that team members hold each other accountable will go a long way toward ensuring success.

 Of course, it can accomplish by defining who is responsible for what, providing team progress, and recognizing the goals completed by the team. 

* **Empower team ownership:** To create a compelling and fantastic team, you must correctly ensure the top-down management approach. You will avoid a situation where only managers are concerned with the organization's or the team's goals.
