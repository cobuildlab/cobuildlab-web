Importance of being part of a tech community when you are innovating or <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/software-development-for-new-products/">   developing new software projects </a> is of utmost importance. Even if you are a non-technical cofounder, knowing the market and innovation will allow you to be more disruptive. It is a source of inspiration and connections. 

These events and communities keep you up to date and help you stay ahead of the curve to be more competitive in the global and local marketplace.  

In addition to the professional advantages of making connections within the technology community, there are also personal benefits, especially in these uncertain times when many people are distancing themselves socially and working remotely. 

Joining a group within the community is a great way to connect with people and reduce feelings of loneliness. Many community events are now held virtually, making it easier to access and connect with industry professionals, albeit through a screen.
