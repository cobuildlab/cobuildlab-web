Analytics and information are fundamental for the efficiency and optimization of a company. And on their own, they are a multi-billion dollar business. Just ask Google and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/"> Facebook. </a>

That's why analytical tools exist. Thanks to them, you can have better data management and take advantage in the commercial and competitive environment. 

In the digital era, massive amounts of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/big-data-benefits-for-your-SME/"> data </a> are produced every year, and these tools (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> off-the-shelf or customized </a>) organize and analyze that information correctly. Here we show you a little more about these analytic tools and 5 reasons to develop one.

<br>

<title-2>Get to know an analytical tool</title-2>

<br>

Data analytics tools are used to classify software and applications that are used by data analysts to create and execute analytical processes that help companies make smarter, more informed business decisions, minimizing costs and increasing profits. 

Most organizations use more than one <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Statistical-Report-and-Analysis-of-Logistics-Software-have-already-been-released-by-the-third-parties-involved-in-the-industry/"> analytics </a> tool, including spreadsheets with statistical functions, statistical software packages, sophisticated data mining tools, and predictive modeling tools. 

Analytics tools similarly examine the behavior of machines, networks, and processes to determine whether they evidence operational problems or have been invaded by malware. But these tools not only detect incidents but also assess risk and prioritize alerts for remediation.

<br>

<title-2>Company areas where you can use analytics software</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Analytical software used to increase customer retention:</title-3>

<br>

Analytics software allows a company to observe customer trends and then market its products with its customers specifically in mind. And the more data a company has about its customer base, the more accurately it can observe customer trends and patterns, ensuring that the company can deliver exactly what its customers want. 

With the analytics provided by such software, companies can retain more customers, and provide solutions to their problems and needs.

<br>

By analyzing customer data, patterns, and online trends, you can make a great marketing campaign by showing your customers what they are looking for and what they want to see. 

This also helps you to attract new customers and retain existing ones, which is what the company is really looking for, to consolidate strong loyalty from their customers.

<title-3>* Analytical software is used for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Technical-analysis-for-software-startup-investors/"> risk management: </a></title-3>

<br>

A company that does not have a forward-looking risk plan may not last long. Thanks to analysis software, it is possible to collect and analyze the vast internal data available in the company's archives that can help develop risk management models for both the short and long term. 

With them, the company can identify future risks and make much more strategic business decisions. This in turn translates into higher future revenues and better market positioning.

<br>

<br>

Managing a company's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Supply-chain-synchronization/"> supply chain </a> can be a complicated task. Thanks to analytics software, companies can more securely and efficiently manage their entire supply chains such as their raw materials, the products in their warehouse inventories, and the details of their retailers to understand their production and shipping needs, which will make supply chain management much easier, leading to fewer errors and, consequently, fewer losses for the company.

<title-3>* Analytical software is used for the creation of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/new-product-development-for-small-business/"> new products: </a></title-3>

<br>

Companies can use data such as feedback from previous products, customer feedback forms, competitor product successes, to understand what types of products customers want and then work on that. 

In the same way, companies can use this data to improve old products depending on the demand in the market and become much more successful and popular.

<br>

<title-2>5 advantages of implementing analytics software</title-2>

Security is a key issue when it comes to customer and company information. This software allows you to protect the information from both external and internal attacks.

<br>

<title-3>* Delivering relevant products:</title-3>

<br>

Effective data collection from third-party sources where individuals post their thoughts and opinions, combined with analytics, will help companies remain competitive when demand changes or new technology is developed, as well as make it easier to anticipate what the market is demanding to offer the product before it is requested.

<br>

<title-3>* Personalization:</title-3>

<br>

Being able to react in real-time and make the customer feel personally valued is only possible through advanced analytics.

Microsoft Power BI is an analytics tool that assists in reporting, data mining, and data visualization to provide business insights.

* Powerful customization capabilities allow users to create dashboards so they can access the data they need quickly
* Alerts can be set up on KPIs to keep users up to date on important metrics and measurements.
* Power BI has an intuitive interface that makes it much easier to use and easier to navigate than complex spreadsheets.
