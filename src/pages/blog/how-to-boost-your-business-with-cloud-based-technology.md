Miami, FL. Mar 21, 2021.

As time goes by, technology surprises us and shows us things we could only imagine before. Such is the case of intangible services hosted on the network: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/best-cloud-based-solutions-in-the-market-2021/">   The cloud</a>. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/cloud-logistics-software-solution/">   Cloud-based services</a> represent on-demand IT solutions, providing storage and impressive processing power that can be accessed over the Internet or through private paid platforms. 

One of the most valuable aspects of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">   cloud-based services</a> is renting a service provider to have their IT infrastructure without owning their own data center. In this way, any company gets storage capacity and access to anything, such as custom-designed platforms or applications.

A beneficial advantage of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/cloud-computing-for-the-logistics-industry/">   cloud-based solutions</a> is that companies can avoid the upfront costs and complexity of owning and maintaining their own IT infrastructure. As mentioned above, they can pay for what they use, when they use it, according to their needs.

In addition, being a service that can be obtained economically, it generates scalable profitability, providing the service to a wide range of customers. Let's see how it works in more detail. 

Suppose you are still struggling to identify the variety of services that can provide with cloud technology. In that case, you may be familiar with Gmail with its cloud that allows the storage of files, photos, and backups of information, or perhaps Netflix, which uses the cloud to host their videos and provide streaming playback service. <Br></Br>

Now that you know what cloud computing is, let's look at some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-using-productivity-tools-in-your-business/">   benefits of implementing this technology</a>:

<b><title-4>1. Cost:</title-4></b> The first thing we look at when embarking on a new venture is cost. Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of purchasing hardware and software, on-site facilities and data centers, cooling, electricity, and other costs related to having a physical IT infrastructure. Of course, we can't leave out the expense of expert staff to manage the IT infrastructure. <Br></Br>

<b><title-4>2. Global-scale:</title-4></b> When we invest in something, we want it to last, and when its growth is exponential, the offer becomes much more attractive. Cloud-based services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud parlance, this means providing the right amount of computing resources - e.g., more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth - just when they are needed and from the right geographic location. <Br></Br>

<b><title-4>3. Performance:</title-4></b> The performance of cloud-based services is fast and efficient. Cloud computing services are run in secure centers on a global network, constantly upgraded. It offers several advantages over a single corporate data center, such as reduced network latency for applications and more significant economies of scale. <Br></Br>

<b><title-4>4. Security:</title-4></b> Another essential aspect is the confidence of having information in a safe place, away from threats, even more so when hosting third-party information. Cloud-based service providers offer a comprehensive set of policies and controls that considerably strengthen their security standards, helping protect the hosted information, whatever its nature, preventing damage from external and network threats. <Br></Br>

In the following video, you can see in detail what the cloud is, how it works, and its benefits. <Br></Br>

These are some of the utilities of cloud-based services:

<b><title-4>1. Create cloud-native applications:</title-4></b> With cloud technology, I could build applications (web, mobile, and APIs), deploy them and scale quickly. Take advantage of cloud resources such as Kubernetes, microservices architecture, API-based communication, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/devops-explanation-and-benefits/">   DevOps</a>. <Br></Br>

<b><title-4>2. Store information:</title-4></b> This may be the most common function of the cloud: data storage and the ability to back it up and recover it in the event of data loss. The cloud offers high-security standards and provides cost-effectiveness when working with data transfer over the Internet, with the possibility of accessing that information from anywhere. <Br></Br>

<b><title-4>3. Data analysis:</title-4></b>  Unify your data across teams, divisions, and locations in the cloud. Aspects such as machine learning and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/can-artificial-intelligence-program-a-software-tool/">   artificial intelligence</a> are leveraged by cloud services to discover information that allows you to make more informed decisions. <Br></Br>

<b><title-4>4. Stream audio and video:</title-4></b> With cloud technology, you can connect with your audience anywhere, anytime through high-definition audio and video worldwide. <Br></Br>

<b><title-4>5. Provide on-demand software:</title-4></b> Better known as software as a service (SaaS), this refers to on-demand software that allows you to deliver the latest software versions and updates to customers anytime, anywhere. <Br></Br>

- Customized data storage
- Cloud-hosted services

We are getting increasingly into intangible services, and we are leaving aside the need for extensive and cumbersome facilities to make our processes work. Cloud-based services offer many <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/5-steps-to-take-for-sustainable-business-expansion/">   possibilities</a> for those who need to store large amounts of information, either for personal or business interests. It is also an excellent option to provide high-quality and innovative services.

If you generally have your head in the clouds, you're on the right track. Taking advantage of the cloud is the best option for companies related to the technology market. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/software-startup-investor">   Let's build a great idea</a> and take your business to the clouds.
