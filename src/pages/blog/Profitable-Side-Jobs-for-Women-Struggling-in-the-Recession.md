Women have been [hit hard](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/11/economy/women-disadvantaged-economy-coronavirus/index.html) by the recession, and if you’re one of the many who’s struggling, you might be looking for sources of extra income. When you hear the term “side hustle,” Uber drivers and Instacart shoppers might be the first things that come to mind. Due to the pandemic, there’s certainly a need for more delivery drivers. However, if you’re staying home with your family or taking care of your kids, venturing out into a stressful environment every day is probably the last thing you feel like doing. 

For women looking to boost their income during the recession, there are plenty of other options, and none of them require leaving home. Learn about some of the best opportunities you can take advantage of below, and find tips for getting started.

<title-2>Consider Your Strengths</title-2>

There are endless ways to boost your income online, but it’s important to think about where your strengths are when weighing your options.

Working from home is a dream for many women and stay-at-home moms because of the flexibility. However, that doesn’t mean it’s always easy. Dealing with distractions from your family and [maintaining a work-life balance](https://mominformed.com/a-moms-guide-to-getting-a-great-work-life-balance/) is often a huge hurdle to get over.  

Not only that, you may face logistical challenges if you plan on running a business from your home. Most types of online, home-based businesses don’t present an issue. However, if your business requires a fair amount of behind-the-scenes, mundane tasks, or if you’re struggling to keep up, it might be time to consider automation to help you along.

Setting up a desk in a quiet corner, using a room divider, putting on noise cancelling headphones and establishing rules about when you shouldn’t be distrubed will all help you stay on task.

No matter where you set up your workspace, it’s important to gather all of the tech you’ll need to succeed. At the very least, you’ll need a laptop or desktop computer and a [strong internet connection](https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-how-to-boost-your-internet-speed-when-everyone-is-working-from-home).
