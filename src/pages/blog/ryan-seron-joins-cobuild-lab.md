Miami, FL. March 18th, 2021 - This 2021 has brought new opportunities and new faces to Cobuild Lab and we couldn’t be more excited! Ryan Seron is joining our team leading business development for Enterprise <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/software-development-for-new-products/"> Software Development </a>. <br> </br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanseron/"> Ryan Seron </a>, former Sr. Executive Recruiter at CyberCoders with over 10 years of Inside Sales / Outside Sales and Business development experience, Ryan has closed $9M+ career revenues with Fortune 100/500 brands and US Government enterprise state and local levels.  With vast expertise in consultative sales, account management, marketing, and B2B sales we’re sure he will be a key piece to our Company.  <br> </br>


<block-quote> Even though 2020 hit hard for everybody, we’re very thankful since a lot of doors opened up for our company. This 2021  started very strong, pushing us to the point where it was pretty clear we couldn’t do everything ourselves, we needed more people in our team; and for us, working in Tech means working in the future, therefore, we knew right from the start that we needed to look for passionate people who could visualize our dreams and goals. Ever since we met Ryan we saw further than a resume, we met his creative and passionate side, he is a goal-oriented person and we were convinced that he’ll make a great asset for our team </block-quote> <br> </br>

From now on, Ryan will be responsible for generating leads and meeting sales goals. He will be in charge of giving sales presentations and product demonstrations to a range of prospective clients, as well as negotiating,  preparing, and submitting sales contracts for orders. In order to maintain client records, he would have to frequently get in touch with potential clients to evaluate needs or promote products and services, answering client questions or doubts.  <br> </br>

   We were curious about what drove him to work at a software development company, here’s what he had  to say: <br> </br>
     
   <block-quote>Working for a software development company was something completely new for me, but I’m a very curious and goal-oriented person, so I decided not to look at this as a challenge but as an opportunity to learn something new and to grow within the company.
     
I've always enjoyed teamwork, and my achievements are my team’s achievements as well.</block-quote> <br> </br>

We’d like to finish this post by quoting Apple’s founder Steve Jobs: “People who are crazy enough to believe they can change the world, are the ones who do”. We’re sure that Ryan’s deep understanding of the sales process and dynamics will help him succeed in his role and would boost the Company’s ROI, so let’s just wish him all the best.   Thank you so much for reading! <br> </br>
