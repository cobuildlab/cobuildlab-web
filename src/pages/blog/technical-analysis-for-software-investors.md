Miami, FL. July 28, 2022

Is it a good idea to <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Technical-analysis-for-software-startup-investors/">   invest in a software app </a>? According to a report prepared by Google and Accel Partners, the global software market in the small and medium-sized business segment is estimated at $50 billion per year, and the enterprise software market is estimated at more than $200 billion per year. 

These figures indicate that the software tools market is big business today.

When investing in <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   development projects </a> like these, you should consider many factors, such as the development place, targeted market segment, and design factors. 

If you want to learn more about **technical analysis for software investors**, read below and make your best decision.

<br>

<title-2>What is technical analysis for software investors?</title-2>

<br>

The technical analysis for software investors is nothing more than an in-depth study performed by the investor to see the feasibility of a development project. To carry out this analysis, the investor must ask himself in which startup I invest? What do I need to understand about using and distributing my resources in the development project? And how to follow the development of the new product? How do I recognize the points to improve in developing a startup I have financially supported? Etc. 

When an entrepreneur calls a startup to invest in the project, any investor asks himself questions. 

These are questions that any investor asks himself when an entrepreneur knocks on his door looking for financial support to develop his software project. 

Likewise, you can take into account the company's statistics, previous successful products in the market, current financial status, the value of the company in the market, or if it is listed on the stock exchange, among others.

<br>

<title-2>What is the purpose of this technical analysis? Only for investors?</title-2>

<br>

Technical analysis has several benefits for software investors when investing their money in these development projects, and we show them below:

<br>

<title-3>* A clear description of the problem that your business is trying to solve in the market</title-3>

<br>

It includes proof that customers are willing to pay to solve the problem and how your product or service lessens the pain or solves the problem.

<br>

<title-3>* Knowing the high growth potential</title-3>

<br>

Your business must address a large or growing market opportunity, and you clearly understand your target market's customer segments and competitive landscape.

<br>

<title-3>* It works to understand the sustainable competitive advantage</title-3>

<br>

You should already have a few large competitors or well-funded new entrants in the target market. Investors want to see a protected technology or a business model that will provide a sustainable advantage for the business and its customers.

<br>

<title-3>* Understanding your financial return on investment (ROI)</title-3>

<br>

You need to have developed a solid financial plan demonstrating how the company will make money and some reasonable scenarios for when your investors will receive a cash return on investment. Of course, it must be supported by the valuation and terms of the current investment round that the company asks the investor to consider.

<br>

<title-3>* What level of involvement is required?</title-3>

<br>

The level of involvement with investing in a startup corresponds to the type of investment. 

For example, someone who invests in a startup through a venture capital firm, for instance, would have limited interaction with the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuild-lab.com/">   startup's team </a>. On the other hand, an angel investor is looking at a very different scenario.

With angel investments, the investor receives an equity stake in the company, which means they have the opportunity to participate in decision-making, along with the startup's leadership. 

In comparison, an investor funding a startup's crowdfunding campaign would receive an equity stake but would not have the exact scope of control as an angel investor. 

Ultimately, it is essential to be clear about how much or how little you would like to participate in giving money to a startup.

<br>

<title-3>* How does the investment affect diversification?</title-3>

<br>

Diversification is the benchmark of any solid investment portfolio, and the number one goal is minimizing risk without curtailing returns. Investors must know how it affects their overall asset mix and risk level when considering a startup investment. Finding the right balance, however, can be tricky. 

With stocks, clear divisions between asset classes make it easier to spread the risk out. 

Startups require a different way of thinking because it's a hit-or-miss proposition. 

As a general rule, the more startups an investor puts money into, the greater the odds of achieving target returns. Spreading investment dollars too thin can backfire if there isn't a winner.

<title-2>Steps to perform technical analysis for software startups</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Establish clear communication paths:</title-3>

<br>

Starting from day one, ensure the roles are well-defined and everyone knows who handles what. People will request access to external systems, ask for clarifications, or signal emergencies. Whatever the scenario, ensure the key contact persons are easily identified. 

Keep this information in a prominent location and make it accessible to everyone.

<br>

<title-3>*  <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/practices-for-validating-your-business-idea-for-your-software/">   Idea validation and estimation: </a></title-3>

<br>

Idea validation is a big step. As part of the product discovery process, it's about connecting the dots between what you intend to create and invest in and whether anyone will want to use it. It's when you validate assumptions, hypotheses, and guesses to find answers to the actual demand for the product. Measuring it helps you plan the project's budget and timeline. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/validating-your-business-idea-part-2/">   Idea validation </a> includes many processes (customer interviews, surveys, etc.) and questions to ask. In this phase, you move from defining problems to finding solutions to determine the desired characteristics of the product.

The detailed estimate delves into each step's planning, software features, SDLC models, and the people involved in creating your product. 

It also accounts for the hours needed to devise your software by assigning them to each specialist on your team. 

So once we have the critical data, you can get a rough estimate of what your software will cost you. It gives you rough figures based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.navigateaccelerator.com/post/validating-your-idea-the-first-step-to-create-your-startup">   validation of the idea </a>, the product's necessary features, and the stakeholders' experience in similar projects.

<br>

<title-3>* Requirements and feasibility analysis:</title-3>

<br>

Requirements and feasibility analysis makes detailed estimation and planning complete. It looks at whether the software you want to build is viable for your needs or calls for changes before design and development are in full swing. 

For this, technical feasibility must be done to check if your project is viable regarding resources and <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Custom-software-Artificial-intelligence-IoT/">   technological stack </a>. It analyzes the infrastructure you will bet on, your team's capabilities, the type of software, and the intermediate technology. 

Its results will show you if you need to make any technical improvements to achieve the best result.

Similarly, the legal side must be considered; this analysis examines the legal requirements your product must meet and whether you have planned for compliance. Often, legal feasibility covers privacy and data security laws such as GDPR or CCPA, intellectual property rights, and local regulations.

Regarding the legal aspect of your project, the requirements and feasibility analysis results should appear in the software development documents. You sign off on that part of the client onboarding process to explicitly write down what needs to be done for compliance.

<br>

<title-3>* To know the combustion index:</title-3>

<br>

The burning rate is the money needed over the long term to the estimated monthly expense ratio. It is where you must make the necessary amount of investment until the startup becomes productive on its own.

It may not be a risk factor per se, but if itâ€™s not well calculated, it can become one. The entrepreneur usually calculates this information, but we recommend that you as an investor do it too, so there is less margin for error.

<br>

<title-3>* Soft security audit:</title-3>

<br>

Even if security was the priority during the development of your organization's software, regular updates are needed to outrun cybercriminals and hackers. Having your software systems tested for bugs, flaws, and vulnerabilities regularly can save you money in the long run and protect you from data breaches that undermine the integrity of your brand and damage your reputation.
