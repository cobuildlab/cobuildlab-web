VMware, of course, did as much as any company to popularize virtualization in the data center – arguably the company is the “original” private cloud company. In the early days of cloud, many companies simply fully virtualized their data center and called it a private cloud.

Moreover, in today’s cloud world, VMware is often thought of as a “bridge” between the private and public cloud worlds. It also offers the vRealize Suite Cloud Management Platform, which can manage both private and hybrid clouds, and Cloud Foundation, a software-defined data center platform designed for private clouds.

<title-2>Why do we at Cobuild Lab consider AWS the ideal partner?</title-2>

<br>

At Cobuild Lab we use AWS as our cloud-based solutions provider, so here are some of the benefits of having AWS as a provider:

* **Available worldwide**, AWS has 20 global data centers, each of which operates in multiple availability zones.

* **Scalability and Flexibility**,AWS offers unlimited flexibility and scalability. AWS Cloud Automation is one such tool that provides on-demand scaling. This allows companies to save and reduce costs.

* **Security**, AWS offers security tools that are not typically available in cheaper alternatives accessible on the market. Organizations can directly deploy these tools in individual IT environments. After deploying these tools, data is secure. 

* **Utilized for Big Data**, AWS has scalable storage that can be used to run analytics more frequently. AWS storage does not require much effort to be indexed as well. The perfect recipe for building data lakes or warehouses. AWS and Big Data work together to provide the infrastructure and power to meet the requirements of high-end intelligent software. 

* **API**, APIs are available in several programming languages to help you manage your infrastructure programmatically. Whether it's launching a new instance or performing backups, everything is possible through the API. The APIs are more powerful than the AWS Management Console.

* **Little or No Investment**, With AWS cloud-related services, organizations are saved from excess expenditures on software and hardware. A physical data center is not required, which results in savings of operating costs. 

It is also used for web development, mobile, gaming, social applications, storage, backup, and enterprise IT, among others. 

Cloud computing has grown into a vast and complex ecosystem of technologies, products, and services. It has given rise to a multi-billion dollar economy with many cloud providers competing for an ever-expanding share of the cloud market, estimating an increase in this market to $927.51 billion by 2027.
