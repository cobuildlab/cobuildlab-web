<title-2>SEO tips for success</title-2>

**1. Work on your speed as if it were about saving your life**

<youtube-video id="13jOMJhKISE"></youtube-video>

Three seconds is the longest time your web page should take to load it. You have to eliminate every element that makes it slow. 

It is demonstrated that the loading speed influences on the position you have in search engines. Why? Because visitors leave a slow website and fewer views and visits mean poor content according to the [latest update of the Google algorithm](https://searchengineland.com/faq-all-about-the-new-google-rankbrain-algorithm-234440).

If your website delays in loading you’ll lose visits, your content will lose relevance and it would go to the last places in this search engine. So, the first SEO technique that you can do is to improve the loading speed. 

It can be using a better server, eliminating all elements that you are not using, optimizing images, eliminating cache, and all information that is not necessary. 

Here is the proof

**2. Work for as many featured fragments as you can**

It is demonstrated that featured fragments position you higher on Google search results, and a lot. 

In case you didn't know, featured fragments are these charts that you can see above the regular results in the Search Engine Results Pages (SERP), with lists, or a brief about a search you made. 

How you can have one? Well, there isn’t a formula for that yet. [Google recommends](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6229325?hl=en) that you make a good structure of your information mainly, create content that is relevant to people searching for answers and they will do the rest.

These [code snippets](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/article) for getting rich results you can do it for free following the steps that Google provides for you.

**3. Mobile is first**

In this 2019 if a website doesn’t have a mobile version including a responsive design practically does not exist for Google. 

There are studies like the one who made the [Blue Corona team](https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/mobile-marketing-statistics) that show that customers feel better with the mobile experience. That applies to searches and sells. 

![seo-tip3](media/Mobile-Marketing-usage-b2b-768x434.png)

Most searches on Google are made for mobile devices, that’s why Google is supporting and positioning these brands that understand it, and are producing content to consume on mobile. 

**4. Mention and link own content and content from others**

For sure, you have heard about a SEO technique called link building where you put links from another website in the content that you publish or vice versa. In that way, you would get more visits and also the websites you that you refer.

This happens bilaterally. You publish the link from others and the others publish link yours. In that way, is being built a kind of network. 

This has been very popular the last years, but now, Google goes beyond, and it is not necessary to put the link. From now, Google can associate the content without a physical link.  In effect, if there are comments or your brand is mentioned Google will know it, and that will give you relevance in the search engine. 

You only have to be sure of one thing: all websites that will have a relationship with your website must produce high quality and relevant content. They should have a good online reputation. 

5. Write for a human before for the search engines 

This is the last tip but we think that is the most important. Why do we think this? Because this tip will guarantee relevant and good content, and that is the most important thing when you have a website. 

You have followers, a community that you have to attend and satisfy. The easier way to improve your position on Google is giving them good and valuable content. 

That’s why we think that you have to write first for people, for this community who consume your content, and then apply some techniques that push a little more your content. 

But if you write thinking in search engines first, maybe your content is not so nice for people who read it. 

That happened before. People tended to write for Google and search engines, and the content was not friendly. It might even seem that was written by a machine. 

That is the last you want now. Google actually penalize this content that looked forced and it is not friendly or natural.
