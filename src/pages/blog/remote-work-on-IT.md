Miami, FL.November 23, 2022

As **remote work on IT** teams becomes increasingly common, managers embrace the benefits they provide.

A Future Workforce Pulse report revealed that hiring managers saw an increase in employee <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/Remote-work-team-productivity-how-to-manage-your-processes/">   productivity </a> due to remote work. Due to the effectiveness of remote work and its perceived benefits, some 36.2 million workers are expected to go fully remote by 2025.

But if the shift to a distributed workforce can bring clear advantages, doing so also poses new management challenges.  

Each company will have its issues and solutions that best suit the particular needs of its remote team members. But in many types of organizations with remote workers, some challenges constantly arise.

Fortunately, these obstacles can be overcome with simple but effective management strategies. This article details some of the most common challenges in managing a remote team and explains how to overcome them.

<title-2>Some challenges faced by remote IT teams</title-2>

<br>

* **Consistent communication:** Communication can make or break any team. For distributed workforces, however, the manner, frequency, and style of your communication can be essential.  

Many challenges relate to the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/benefits-of-using-productivity-tools-in-your-business/">   virtual tools </a> that remote teams use. Emails can be missed or misread. Chat messaging can arrive at busy moments. Miscommunication arises in traditional office settings too, but <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/exercises-to-promote-the-mental-health-of-your-remote-developers-team/">   remote teams </a>’ reliance on these tools considerably increases the likelihood of it happening.

Additionally, critical contextual cues can be lost or missing when interactions occur on these digital platforms. A written message creates ample opportunity for misinterpretation, especially about its sender’s tone and intentions. In the context of a global team, cultural differences and language barriers can also create confusion.

* **Tracking work and productivity:** When many teams were forced to work remotely, many managers became concerned about <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/from-desk-to-dawn-how-the-remote-work-lifestyle-affect-productivity/">   productivity </a>. How can I know if my employees are doing their jobs when I can't see them? Concerns around productivity and the perception that people are not working from home, but lounging in their infinity pools, can be a challenge when considering a remote work program or managing remote employees.

* **Balancing trust and accountability:** Building trust is difficult for managers and remote team members. Managers worry that workers will not complete the work, while workers have several concerns, such as whether they will be paid on time (or at all, in some cases). Being transparent can help build trust for all parties, especially when working remotely. However, just as with an in-office team, you will need to balance adequate supervision and stifling scrutiny. On the other hand, you must provide the information and expectations necessary for your team to execute effectively.
 
* **Coordinating tasks and projects:** Managing different schedules, time zones, and workloads add another difficulty to task and project coordination. Ensuring that all client needs are met can be challenging unless a project coordination system has been <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/web-development/">   developed </a>. By coordinating who is in charge of what aspect of the project, each team member understands their role in achieving the common goal. And project managers play a critical role in this regard.

* **Creating connection:** Leading a distributed workforce demands adapting traditional approaches to cultivating strong company culture. For example, in-person perks and events may not be accessible to all team members—if they’re feasible. Likewise, building camaraderie isn’t as simple as gathering in the kitchen for Monday morning bagels.

However, creating and maintaining a warm and positive collective vibe among team members is crucial to <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/switching-to-remote-work-is-the-new-black/">   remote work’s </a> success. While a remote job entails many benefits, it can sometimes feel isolating. Because remote professionals don’t have face-to-face interactions, you’ll need to cultivate a sense of inclusion and collaboration intentionally.

<title-2>Solutions to these challenges</title-2>

* **How do you overcome challenges communicating with remote employees?**

There are many aspects to communication, each with its challenges and ways to overcome them. Here are a few ideas to consider:

1. Ask your remote team members to ensure their online calendars are up-to-date to make scheduling recurring, one-off, or ad-hoc meetings easier for everyone.

2. Use the right video conferencing software (e.g., Google Meet) to align with your team's work.

3. Set clear communication guidelines for when and how remote workers should use instant messaging vs. email vs. phone vs. video conference.

4. Use an appropriate intranet <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/web-development/">   software platform </a> (e.g., Microsoft Teams) to share work resources and information effectively.

5. Remove bureaucracy and red tape that results in unnecessary communication.

* **How do you overcome the challenge of managing remote employee productivity?**

Embedded in these comments are some great ideas on how to ensure productivity, effective coordination, and positive collaboration with remote employees, including:

1. Implement the CRA leadership model to help remote workers rally around a clear vision and purpose that drives specific goals and deliverables.

2. Have a single shared calendar and other virtual <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/5-tools-that-can-help-to-manage-your-team%27s-time-and-tasks/">   collaboration tools </a> to maintain alignment between remote teams.

3. Conduct regular 1:1 check-ins with your people that give you visibility into each other’s activities without micromanaging. To help, check out my guide to 1:1 meetings with the template.

* **How do you overcome trust issues and build trust with a remote team?**

Building trust is not easy and requires time, patience, and persistence. Going into detail on all the ways to build trust is an article, but building trust usually starts with assuming positive intent.  

This mindset change is required to start the cycle of trust with remote team members. If you can assume positive intent, some trusted trust-building activities are:

1. Create a living trust agreement.

2. Establish SMART goals and OKRs (objectives and key results) that employees can commit to and follow through on.

3. Be open and transparent, show vulnerability, and be willing to admit your own mistakes.

4. Communicate from the highest levels of the organization that you trust your employees.

* **How do you overcome task and project coordination problems with a remote team?**

1. Ensure team members are involved from the start. Having to explain the goals and scope halfway through the project can inhibit productivity. For this reason, all team members must be included in the project from the start, as adding a person halfway through the project can slow everyone down.

2. Start the project with a meeting. Even if your distributed team is in different time zones, it’s essential to set a forum in which everyone is included to kick off the project. The team should define the project goal, scope, and timeline during this meeting.

3. Stay in communication. Communicate with your team to discuss the project and offer support when needed. Although instant messaging helps keep in touch about project progress, video conferencing tools like Google Meet or Zoom can help cut through any confusion. In addition, hopping on quick calls to clarify specific tasks or answer questions can often cut back on time you would have spent typing a detailed explanation in a chat or email.

* **How do you overcome the problems of creating a connection with a remote team?** 

1. Celebrate success. Whether you give shoutouts during weekly Zoom happy hours or do virtual high-fives throughout the week on Slack, highlighting success in creative—and public—ways can help connect team members. Sharing the high points of everyone’s workweek makes workers feel seen, included, and appreciated, which translates to a greater desire to perform well for the company.

2. Make time to meet. Remote teams can drift toward impersonal communication methods. When a question or issue arises, sending an email or chat message is straightforward. However, take the time to recognize when a meeting might be better. You can enrich professional relationships using video conferencing, particularly within teams working toward a shared goal. The video piece is essential: There’s something undeniably personal about making eye contact.

3. Keep the announcements and updates coming. Nothing erodes culture like confusion about the company’s direction. Regular updates on everybody’s progress, company goals, and other essential group announcements can unify team members through a shared sense of purpose.

Managing **remote work on IT** only requires you to know some aspects of your organization. Still, you must understand what each team member is expected to do, their challenges, and their responsibilities. When you don't have these answers, it's impossible to demonstrate leadership or empathy.

Good communication tops the to-do list when managing remote teams. So be sure to follow up with all teams and select members regularly, optimize processes as needed, and lead from the front to set a good example.

Your most valuable resource is your people. The stakes are high when it comes to your employees. If you implement these tips, your team's performance will improve. If you need help building your team, don't hesitate to <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">   contact us. </a>
