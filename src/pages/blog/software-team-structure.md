Miami, FL. September 23, 2022

The **software team structure** plays an essential role in the success of a project. Other factors, such as the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/hire-remote-software-developers/">  developers </a>' expertise, experience, and talent, are crucial. 

However, proper management and team structure can facilitate and streamline development. 

Here's a little more about these structures and how you can get the most out of them:

<br>

<title-2>Importance of having the right software team structure</title-2>

<br>

A <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">  software development team's </a> structure depends on factors such as the type and complexity of your software product, the time you have to deliver the product, and the budget allocated. Waterfall or <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/advantages-of-agile-software-development/"> agile development </a> directly affects workflows and team composition. 

A project management methodology determines the team size, the responsibilities of its members, and the relationships within the group.

To assemble the perfect development team, carefully analyze the prerequisites and determine the size of the group, choose the team structure that best suits your project, and make sure you have all the necessary functions of the <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/"> software development team </a> covered. 

Once the essential functions are covered, set up project management software to streamline day-to-day operations, provide transparency into project processes, and establish productive communication. People are the key to your product's success. Even if the lack of a few specialists seems normal during the development process, it could have an effect at the end of the day. 

<br>

<title-2>Factors defining the software team structure</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>The type and complexity of your project:</title-3>

<br>

If you need to prove your concept and build an <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/MVP-software-development/">  MVP </a>, a team of four to six specialists may be enough. However, suppose you’re going to completely redesign an existing app, launch a fully functioning product, or deal with another complex software solution. In that case, the number of team members you’ll need will increase.

<br>

<title-3>The time to complete the project:</title-3>

<br>

How quickly the product needs to be turned around will also influence the structure and size of the team. 

With fewer team members, it may take longer to complete the project. So, suppose you have a cutting-edge product idea that needs to be developed from scratch with a tight deadline. In that case, you may need to assemble an extended team of senior engineers or a group of full-stack engineers who can cover all the needs and deliver results quickly and efficiently.

<br>

<title-3>The budget allocated to development:</title-3>

<br>

Intertwined with the above factors, the funding available will undoubtedly affect every decision you make, from the number of team members you can hire to the seniority of specialists you can bring in to the number of features your product can have when it's ready. 

To reduce project costs without sacrificing quality in the early stages of development, consider opting for any agile <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/top-project-management-software-tools/"> project management </a> methodologies. You could deliver in increments, focusing on high-priority features first, and have more cost flexibility.

<br>

<title-3>Conditions of team collaboration:</title-3>

<br>

In hybrid teams, specialists may often not understand each other, or in other cases, they may become co-dependent and ineffective in their collaboration. 

So you need to have general expertise in many areas of product development (design, programming, domain knowledge, marketing, etc.) to coordinate the specialists and help them communicate with each other. Or you will need to hire a person with general knowledge, such as a product manager.

<br>

<title-2>Team structure</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Generalists:</title-3>

<br>

This approach is perfect for you if you prefer to cooperate with a small software team and do not want to equip your product with numerous complex functions.  By multitasking, switching tasks, and performing multiple functions, your specialists will become universal soldiers to ensure you get to market with a cost-effective solution as quickly as possible.

Software teams like this, typically include specialists with extensive knowledge and experience. While you may require your team members to be experts in a specific area, generalists may lack the expertise to deliver a relevant solution. But if you have limited resources and want to opt for this approach, consider hiring a third party to perform niche-specific tasks. 

<br>

<title-3>Specialists:</title-3>

<br>

If you have in mind a complex project that requires deep expertise, consider applying this approach to get better results. 

Specialists are seasoned programming languages or technologies experts and don’t exchange tasks with their colleagues. Such a software team is perfect for building feature-rich and effective products much faster. Since every team member works individually, specialists might face communication issues, so it’s crucial to equip your team with an experienced <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/when-and-why-to-hire-a-Project-Manager/">  project manager  </a> to eliminate any obstacles. 

<br>

<title-3>Hybrid team:</title-3>

<br>

This approach involves generalists and specialists and is suitable if you require flexibility and deep expertise. Remember that a hybrid team is costly as you will need lots of resources to connect your tech talents. Hybrid software teams can be a fantastic option for big projects—specialists will perform tasks that require deep expertise and develop separate components. Generalists will ensure the system is integrated. 

Though the development lifecycle is more effective with hybrid teams, it might be tough to connect specialists with different approaches to the workflow. These teams need a seasoned PM to provide a client with a sophisticated product as fast as possible.

<title-2>The key roles and responsibilities of every software development team member</title-2>

<br>

<br>

<title-3>Product Owner:</title-3>

<br>

His job is to maintain a product backlog, balance trends and business objectives, define the product roadmap and communicate with the customer to ensure the team receives valuable and relevant feedback. This decision-maker represents both business stakeholders and end users. They understand the customer's requirements and know how the final version of the product should work.

<br>

<title-3>Business Analyst:</title-3>

<br>

Being a reliable mediator between a customer and a team, the business analyst defines market demands and proposes the most appropriate and profitable direction for business development. The main task of this team member is to process the client's business objectives and transform them into specific requirements. This person aligns the business model with the technology to ensure that the customer gets a product that brings value to its audience. 

<br>

<title-3>Project Manager:</title-3>

<br>

In sequential models, a project manager is responsible for distributing tasks among team members, planning work activities, and updating project status. In agile projects, where the focus is on self-management, transparency, and shared ownership, a project manager sets the vision for a product, maintains clarity, fosters communication, seeks improvements in the development process, and ensures that a team delivers more value with each iteration.

<br>

<title-3>Software architect:</title-3>

<br> 

An expert-level software engineer, an architect, is the executive software design decision-maker on an application development team. You will need one if you are dealing with a software product with complex requirements or legacy software that requires profound changes. A software architect decides which services and databases should communicate with each other, how integrations should work, and how to ensure that the product is secure and stable.

<br>

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/top-pros-of-remote-software-developer-service/">  Software developer: </a></title-3>

<br>  


A software team builds products of the highest quality and solves any technical problems encountered during the development lifecycle. 

A strong team usually consists of front-end and back-end engineers. You can also hire full-stack developers with skills in various coding niches. 

Front-end engineers work with the customer-facing elements of your product: they develop the user interface, create pages that are responsive to all devices, and optimize a product for maximum speed. 

Back-end developers are responsible for the functionality of your product. From creating and managing databases to integrating third-party APIs, back-end developers are responsible for the functionality of your product.

<br>

<title-3>UX/UI designer:</title-3>

<br>   

The <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/product-development-process-for-software-products/">  product design process </a> has two aspects: user experience (UX) design and user interface (UI) design. The UX consists of thinking about the entire journey of a user's interaction with a product. A UX designer is therefore involved in user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, etc. On the other hand, a UI designer designs intuitive, user-friendly, and visually pleasing interfaces for a product.

<br>

<title-3>Quality assurance engineer:</title-3>

<br>    

This person catches any bugs before they reach end users and ensures that your product runs smoothly. QA engineers use numerous test environments to look for bugs, from performance and functionality to usability and security. They then report them to a team of developers so they can fix them as quickly as possible.

It is not enough to have an idea for a software product. You need to hire the right people to complete the project smoothly and successfully. 

The agile methodology is probably the best for a <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/services/">  software development team </a> today. 

If you are looking for a software development company to trust with the realization of your dream application, try to consider a team with an agile structure. 

A team that follows modern methodologies can help you create special software and get the most out of your collaboration and the final product.
