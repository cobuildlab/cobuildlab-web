Who doesn't use social networks today? Already there you know that the chances of reaching the audience you want are tripled. 

There are several platforms that allow you to carry out ads campaigns, such as those offered by Google, like [Google Ads](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/tips-to-create-effective-campaigns-in-google-search-engine/), [Google Ad Manager](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/google-ad-manager-the-platform-to-track-your-ad-campaign/) or [Google Marketing Platform](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/google-marketing-platform-another-way-of-google-advertisement/), but each social media platform had to take advantage of the huge market that exists, and that's why they created their own ads platforms, which opened up other social media platforms, such as the case of [Facebooks Ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads), with which ads can also be published on Instagram and other social media platforms.

<title-2>Exactly what are the Social Ads</title-2>

Social Ads are a diminutive for advertising on social networking platforms.

A good thing about this kind of advertisement is that you would have broad objectives for a low investment cost, and also almost perfectly segmented ads, taking into account the information and profile that the same social media platform has built by the users search patterns, followers, preferences, ages, etc.. 

This information that makes the algorithm suggest things we will love, will also help you to segment your ad very well, and appear more accurately to those who are your target audience.

Facebook Ads offers you three types of targets for your ad campaigns, such as awareness, consideration, and conversion.

Depending on the intentions or goals you want to achieve with your campaigns, select any of these options, and your investment, the type of ad, the segmentation, the elements you must integrate, and the overall behavior of the campaign will be different to achieve the goal you set.

* In order for you to know a little bit about this, **Awareness** is used to let your target know that your brand is one of its alternatives. Usually, this type of campaigns is done with new brands, which are just starting in a market, and customers should know them, who they are and what they can do specifically.

* **Consideration** is equivalent to positioning. Once your target knows you, and the recognition phase is done, it is generally applied to the consideration option in Facebook Ads, because with this one, what is searched is to consolidate the image in the market and to be scaling little by little with the campaigns that you are carrying out. 

* **Conversion** campaigns are usually carried out when you are already positioned in the market, but you need to achieve that last step so that those who recognize you and look for you also buy from you. 

What changes with each type of advertisement is mainly the way the investment is made, the extensions that are added and the requirements that you must complete, to complete the ad, such as forms, pictures, videos or links, etc. 

It is also important to add that, in Facebook Ads, you can advertise images, video, carousel, leads ads, you can advertise on Facebook Messenger, images or products collections, and so on. It is a versatile tool.

<title-3>A little of the history</title-3>

Although in the film The Social Network we observed that he opposed the marketing of The Facebook, it turns out that this did happen at some point, with the so-called "flyers", which were banners paid for students or merchants in the area to appear on the platform. Between 10 and 40 dollars cost this type of banners with which many parties and events were announced, even from the same campus of the university. 

From there, more income came with advertisers such as Victoria Secret and Apple, and from there it evolved to what we know today. 

Previously, the company earned a lot for this type of advertisement, and the brands that offered, achieved conversions, but in a generic way. 

When the Power Editor platform is created and later becomes Facebook Ads, is when it becomes much more accessible this type of campaigns for many to earn money sharing quality material.

2. Create your ads by thinking about how people use the social media platform where you are advertising and even try to predict some of the needs or search patterns in which your ad may appear. 
3. This is possible with a good study of personality and consumer behavior.  
Be consistent with the content of your campaigns. Don't contradict yourself, or show little confidence.
4. If you can, link your ad to your profile on the social media platform you are advertising, or instead to your website, but always seek to establish communication. 
5. Choose an ad format that is consistent with the type of content you are publishing in the ad. And it also takes into account the qualities of the social platform you're working on. 
For example, if you want to be very concise and you are using Instagram and your ad is a video, remember that the network is restricted by the time of audiovisuals.
