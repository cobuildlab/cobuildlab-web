Who doesn't use social networks today? Already there you know that the chances of reaching the audience you want are tripled. 

There are several platforms that allow you to carry out ads campaigns, such as those offered by Google, like [Google Ads](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/tips-to-create-effective-campaigns-in-google-search-engine/), [Google Ad Manager](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/google-ad-manager-the-platform-to-track-your-ad-campaign/) or [Google Marketing Platform](https://cobuildlab.com/blog/google-marketing-platform-another-way-of-google-advertisement/), but each social media platform had to take advantage of the huge market that exists, and that's why they created their own ads platforms, which opened up other social media platforms, such as the case of [Facebooks Ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads), with which ads can also be published on Instagram and other social media platforms.

<title-2>Exactly what are the Social Ads</title-2>

Social Ads are a diminutive for advertising on social networking platforms.

Depending on the intentions or goals you want to achieve with your campaigns, select any of these options, and your investment, the type of ad, the segmentation, the elements you must integrate, and the overall behavior of the campaign will be different to achieve the goal you set.

* In order for you to know a little bit about this, **Awareness** is used to let your target know that your brand is one of its alternatives. Usually, this type of campaigns is done with new brands, which are just starting in a market, and customers should know them, who they are and what they can do specifically.

* **Consideration** is equivalent to positioning. Once your target knows you, and the recognition phase is done, it is generally applied to the consideration option in Facebook Ads, because with this one, what is searched is to consolidate the image in the market and to be scaling little by little with the campaigns that you are carrying out. 

* **Conversion** campaigns are usually carried out when you are already positioned in the market, but you need to achieve that last step so that those who recognize you and look for you also buy from you. 

What changes with each type of advertisement is mainly the way the investment is made, the extensions that are added and the requirements that you must complete, to complete the ad, such as forms, pictures, videos or links, etc. 

It is also important to add that, in Facebook Ads, you can advertise images, video, carousel, leads ads, you can advertise on Facebook Messenger, images or products collections, and so on. It is a versatile tool.

Although in the film The Social Network we observed that he opposed the marketing of The Facebook, it turns out that this did happen at some point, with the so-called "flyers", which were banners paid for students or merchants in the area to appear on the platform. Between 10 and 40 dollars cost this type of banners with which many parties and events were announced, even from the same campus of the university. 

From there, more income came with advertisers such as Victoria Secret and Apple, and from there it evolved to what we know today. 

Previously, the company earned a lot for this type of advertisement, and the brands that offered, achieved conversions, but in a generic way.

1. Explore all the social ads options you can use, but focus on where the majority of your audience is concentrated or at least the profile of those who use it is similar to your target audience. Forget your personal preferences. 
2. Create your ads by thinking about how people use the social media platform where you are advertising and even try to predict some of the needs or search patterns in which your ad may appear. 
3. This is possible with a good study of personality and consumer behavior.  
Be consistent with the content of your campaigns. Don't contradict yourself, or show little confidence.
4. If you can, link your ad to your profile on the social media platform you are advertising, or instead to your website, but always seek to establish communication. 
5. Choose an ad format that is consistent with the type of content you are publishing in the ad. And it also takes into account the qualities of the social platform you're working on. 
For example, if you want to be very concise and you are using Instagram and your ad is a video, remember that the network is restricted by the time of audiovisuals.
