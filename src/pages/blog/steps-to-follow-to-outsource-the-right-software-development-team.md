<title-2>Benefits of having an outsourced software team</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Increased access to in-depth knowledge and experience:</title-3>

<br>

The adoption of this work methodology is usually very nourishing and comforting for companies. 

When you hire a remote team you can acquire new knowledge, ideas, and experiences for your company that you didn't have before due to the lack of qualified personnel, and through external hiring that can be obtained very quickly. All of this helps your company grow and stand out from the competition.

<br>

<title-3>Optimal balance of skills and rates:</title-3>

<br>

With outsourcing, you can create the perfect balance between your team's development skills and your rates. The geographic scope of your outsourcing options is broad, with India and Eastern Europe among the most popular software development outsourcing centers.

<br>

<title-3>No need for micromanagement:</title-3>

<br>

The project is coordinated by a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/importance-of-sustainable-software-in-custom-project-development/"> project manager </a> whose job is, as the name suggests, to manage the outsourced software development. 

The project manager handles all issues related to the development and release of your product and will be your main point of contact for any problems that may arise.   

It will also be in charge of activities such as planning sprints, setting deadlines, controlling delivery, scheduling, preparing feature demos, changes, suggestions, comments, and complaints. He will also be your point of contact with the team. 

<br>

<title-3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/improve-communications-to-increase-team-productivity-by-developing-custom-software/">  Effective communication: </a></title-3>

<br>

Improves communication between the work team, since they are isolated without any type of communication, except with the client. 

By improving the communication between them they can guarantee that the client will get what he asks for and that the activities and objectives do not change and are achieved to perfection. 

<br>

<title-3>Application of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/7-reasons-to-make-a-supply-chain-agile-and-resilient-with-robotic-process-automation/"> agile </a> methodology:</title-3>

<br>

Agile methodology allows for on-the-fly review and adaptation of the development process to changing requirements. Throughout the life cycle of a project, this minimizes the need to rework finished components.  

Today, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-agile-methodology-in-project-management/"> agile methodology </a> is the best means and means of software development, allowing the company to deliver a quality product.

<br>

<title-3>High scalability:</title-3>

<br>

Adapting to sudden changes should be part of any work team. Outsourcing allows you to have a great capacity for scalability since the project is developed in different phases and allows you to make changes before the final launch, or even after completion.

<br>

<title-2>Steps to follow to hire the right team</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Verify their work history:</title-3>

<br>

Just like hiring employees, the best way to know if a candidate is worthwhile is through their work history. 

Typically, a software development company's work should speak for itself. This way you can find out if this external company is good at what you do and verify that they will meet your needs.

<br>

<title-3>Verify their vision and workflow:</title-3>

<br>

Knowing their vision as a company is fundamental because it helps you to know a little more about them and correlate it with the vision you have for your project and you will be sure that they will meet your requirements. 

Similarly in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/rpa-vs-workflow-automation-for-business-processes/">  workflow </a>, it is important to remember that you are working on your timeline and that you must be able to finish the project within your deadline. Since software development is a collaborative effort, the team's work process should match your company's workflow.

<br>

<title-3>Post-delivery support:</title-3>

<br>

In technology projects, more than in any other type of project, it is imperative to have the best post-delivery support, not only during the development and implementation process but also during the adoption of the new software. 

Having adequate post-delivery support ensures that the software remains secure, maintained, and improved long after its release. 

<br>

<title-3>Have effective communication channels:</title-3>

<br>

Communication is the lifeblood of the relationship between you and your software development partner. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the lines of communication are always open and that feedback is properly received and acted upon. Having effective communication eliminates development errors.
