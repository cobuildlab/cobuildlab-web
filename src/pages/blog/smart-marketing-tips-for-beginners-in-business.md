You're new to the business world, which means you're probably operating on a shoestring budget. However, you know you need to grow your clientele. You also understand that marketing is the way to get it. Today, marketing is easier than ever as you can get in touch with your audience almost instantly from anywhere and on any budget. If you are thinking of selling your home, why not <a target="_blank" href="https://www.redfin.com/resources/how-to-sell-a-house-online">do it yourself online</a> and use the money you save on real estate fees to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">develop your business</a>?
<br>

Here are a few tips to put you in the best position to capture your fair share of consumer dollars without spending too many of your own, courtesy of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/">Cobuild Lab</a>.

<title-3>Social Media Is Essential</title-3>

An overwhelming percentage (67%) of people worldwide use a mobile device. Since the pandemic began, more than 500 million users have jumped on the social networking bandwagon. That means that just under <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/simon-kemp-social-media/">4.5 billion people</a> use social networks today. That's more than half of the world's population. Knowing this, it makes sense to channel some of your time, energy, and money into social media.

<title-3>Your Visuals Play A Part In Your Success</title-3>

Your storefront, counter, and staff made the first impression on customers in the past. Today, they are your logo and your overall brand. Even if you don't have a degree in graphic design, you can use online tools to create a beautiful, eye-catching logo for any business. Many services allow you to take and customize an icon and text with many different font styles. You can then tweak it until you have the fitting branding symbol representing your company and style. However, be mindful that your logo doesn't make your company look cheap, unclear, or worse, convey a message that can be <a target="_blank" href="https://www.plerdy.com/blog/top-40-bad-logos/">grossly misinterpreted</a>.

<title-3>Go Grassroots</title-3>

Grassroots marketing is ideal for raising awareness for small businesses on a limited budget. You start big through a traditional marketing channel and hope your message reaches the right ears. Grassroots marketing does the exact opposite. By crafting a strategic marketing plan, which may include out-of-the-ordinary promotional actions, you can target small groups and expect them to spread your message for you. Small business marketing expert <a target="_blank" href="https://brandongaille.com/11-fanstastic-grassroots-marketing-examples/">Brandon Gaille explains</a> that grassroots marketing can take the word of mouth, product samples, contests, and business partnerships.

<title-3>Network</title-3>

Networking is similar to grassroots marketing. The significant difference is that you are not targeting a specific audience but rather establishing relationships that will ideally strengthen your business with many networking groups and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nextinsurance.com/blog/best-business-networking-groups/">organizations</a>, such as the local Chamber of Commerce, SCORE, and the Rotary Club. You can also network with former business associates, friends, family, and members of your community. Please don't be shy about handing out a business card to an acquaintance because you never know when they will have a contact that can bring you a contract.

<title-3>Other ideas</title-3>

Other ways to get your name out include:

* Form a solid online presence, consisting of a website, social media, and web directories, including Best Of The Web, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/web-directories-list/287799/#close">Google My Business, and Yelp</a>.

* Make sure your website is mobile-friendly and links to your social media, contact information, and map. Have your contact information clearly stated so customers can call you if they need to.

* Focus on customer service. When your customers <a target="_blank" href="https://talkroute.com/11-sure-ways-to-keep-your-customers-coming-back/">feel valued</a>, like they're part of a community, and like they've had the best possible experience, they'll come back and, just as importantly, tell their friends.

* Increase your business acumen by taking some classes. Choose a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.phoenix.edu/degrees/business/mba.html">flexible and inexpensive</a> that allows you to focus on other responsibilities.

Marketing used to involve vast teams of "publicists," whose job was to create billboards and magazine layouts. Today, many marketing tactics are done autonomously. You don't have to have a big budget either, and by going back to basics, by focusing on modern tools like social media and free graphic design programs, you can be online and in the face of those who matter in a matter of days.
