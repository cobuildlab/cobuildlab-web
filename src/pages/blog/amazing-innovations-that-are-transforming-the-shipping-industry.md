Shipping industry is a vital part of any economy. As the world becomes more integrated, its transport networks have become more robust and flexible. The shipping industry, especially in the United States, has seen dramatic changes in the last decade. And according to experts, it still has a ways to go.

<title-3>History of Shipping Transportation</title-3>

The history of shipping and its technological developments are closely tied to trade accounts, from the early civilizations through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Industrial Revolution.
<br></br>

The transportation of goods by sea was critical to the development of the Ancient Mediterranean civilization. The Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, and the Greeks all engaged in it. The sea-based trade was so important that the word "commerce" derives from "commere," which means to travel for commerce. In the early times, ropes were one of the most critical things used in the shipping industry. They used to load and unload ships and attach anchors to boats and mooring lines to docks. They made the first ropes from natural resources such as palm and olive tree fibers, but they were expensive to produce and hard to maintain. These ropes would often rot or burn at high temperatures and could not be found in sufficient quantities to meet demand. 
<br></br>

As sea transportation declined in the 20th century, the industry has become more focused on transporting goods by air and truck (see containerization). Transporting goods by ship is more complicated than other forms of transport. The shipping industry faces several issues because ships are sensitive to weather and often carry unusual cargo. Ship shapes are generally dictated by hydrodynamics, principally from stability & structures associated with propulsion and buoyancy. Ships must withstand both high external pressure from wind and waves and internal pressure from the buoyancy of their hulls, cargo gear, etc. Marine transport is not for the faint-hearted because it involves a lot of planning before undertaking it.

<title-3>Advancement in the Shipping Industry</title-3>

Till a few years ago, shipping was an industry that was wary of new technologies as it felt that these would only bring in more competition and increase operating costs. But now, it has started to adopt new technologies and machinery like conveyors fast and furiously. To learn more about conveyors and how it helps the shipping industry, <a target="_blank" href="https://fluentconveyors.com/">Click here >> Fluent Conveyors</a>.
<br></br>

With <a target="_blank" target="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/types-of-software-as-a-service/">advancements in software technology</a>, many applications such as ERP, CRM, and WMS facilitate the movement of goods. These applications provide tracking and tracing, customs clearance, and documentation management to various shipping stakeholders. The introduction of cloud computing has made it possible to efficiently connect all the supply chain stakeholders. It helps quickly share information and documents related to shipment between players involved in the process.

<title-2>Here's a look at some of the technologies that are changing the face of shipping industry:</title-2>

<title-4>Global Positioning System (GPS).</title-4>
As you know, GPS is instrumental to your smartphone's ability to pinpoint its location on earth with accuracy. Many shipping companies have now started using GPS for charting their ships' location and speed. It helps them save time and money as charts used to be manually updated before GPS came in.

<title-4>NaviRadar. </title-4>
When combined with GPS, NaviRadar can transmit ship-specific data such as speed and direction from its present location to all other vessels nearby. This information allows ships near each other to avoid a collision.

<title-4>Ship Data Recorder (SDR).</title-4>
Another advancement that has been instrumental in improving safety standards in shipping is Ship Data Recorder (SDR). SDR is a device that records data during a voyage. The SDR captures and stores data on the daily operation of the ship, such as fuel consumption, speed, position, and engine activity. The SDR connects to sensors throughout the ship, including the engine room and bilge pumps. All this data is transmitted in real-time via satellite back to shore for further storage and analysis.

<title-4>ERP(Enterprise Resource Planning)</title-4>
ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems are computer-based integrated software applications used by organizations to help manage their resources throughout the supply chain. In short, ERP enables organizations to plan and automate business processes involved in the production, distribution, servicing, and support of products. ERP is used by almost every company worldwide in practically every industry.
<br></br>
With the help of an ERP, logistics managers can better track shipments, which helps them make more informed decisions about whether to reroute their cargo or employ other strategies for getting goods from point A to point B. They can also minimize costs and inventory precisely by knowing what they have in stock at all times. In addition, ERPs are useful for finding the most efficient routes for shipments and tracking where a company's vehicles are at any given time.
<br></br>

<title-3>CRM <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/custom-customer-management-system">(Customer Relationship Management)</a></title-3>

The application of blockchain technology aims to improve efficiency in areas such as shipping and logistics by providing a secure online ledger that can be used as an auditing tool. CRMs can be used as a digital ledger to validate transactions based on immutable records. The immutability factor of the blockchain makes it ideal for use in shipping logistics. The transactions within the blockchain are recorded and encrypted, making it impossible to alter or tamper with the data stored within it. It can reduce fraud and corruption embedded within this sector in many ways, including sharing accurate data with all relevant parties involved, which reduces information asymmetry.
<br></br>
The introduction of CRM technology helps eliminate duplication and fragmentation by creating a platform on which all parties involved can share data in real-time. For example, a vessel may be carrying five different consignments from five other shippers. With CRM technology, all entities involved (customs authorities, port officials, transporters) will access pertinent information about the shipment.
<br></br>
<title-3>WMS <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/custom-warehouse-management-system">(Warehouse Management Systems)</a></title-3>

In the shipping industry, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/Warehouse-and-Inventory-Management/">WMS software</a> is the backbone of all operations in a distribution center. It controls where products are stored and how they will be shipped to customers. In addition, it allows for tracking routes, inventory, and orders. For this reason, a WMS system is critical to efficient shipping because it reduces errors and speeds up delivery times.
<br></br>

The software is similar to other types of software used in warehouses and factories; however, the shipping industry requires <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/">customized software</a> for their particular needs. A WMS system must handle unique problems such as weather conditions that may affect shipments or many loads that need to arrive on time for holidays.
<br></br>

<title-3>Takeaway</title-3>

The use of technology in the **shipping industry** is in a state of transition. In the end, the purpose of technological changes and upgrades is to improve efficiency across all facets of the shipping trade. The question is, how much will your <a target="_blank" href="http://cllax.com">business</a> be able to benefit from these technological advances? I'd love to hear what you think about this.
