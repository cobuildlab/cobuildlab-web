The use of APIs today is very common because they offer practical solutions for applications that improve their functionality, but wait... not so fast! By any chance do you know how far you can use them and how legal their use is when they come from another company?  Before we get into all of this and consider some ideas on how to use them, we invite you to check out below what an API is.

<Br>

<title-2>What is an API?</title-2>

<Br>

API is the abbreviation for Application Programming Interfaces. They are definitions and protocols used to integrate software or functionality into the development of a custom software tool. 

Simply put, it connects two applications through a set of rules. 

It is a practical and safe way to incorporate proven and secure functionality into any software tool you are developing for your business. 

For example, if you want to work with geolocation, instead of developing the feature from scratch, you can integrate google maps and work with its data and protocols.

<title-2>Why is it good to use APIs?</title-2>

<Br>


**You don't have to invent the wheel, you can reuse code from other applications.** 

**You save time because you only have to integrate and not develop from scratch.** 

**You have the certainty that the code works.** 

**It increases cybersecurity.**

<title-2>Some types of APIs</title-2>

<Br>

<title-3>Open APIs:</title-3>

<Br>

Also known as Public API, there are no restrictions to access these types of APIs because they are publicly available. They may require registration and use of an API key, or they may be completely open.

<Br>

<title-3>Internal APIs:</title-3>

<Br>

Unlike open APIs, internal APIs are designed to be hidden from external users. They are used within a company to share resources.  The company uses this type of API between the different internal teams to improve its products and services.

<Br>

<title-3>Partner APIs:</title-3>

<Br>

Partner APIs are technically similar to open APIs but feature restricted access, often controlled through a third-party API gateway. A developer needs specific rights or licenses to access this type of API because they are not available to the public. 

<Br>

<title-3>Composite APIs:</title-3>

<Br>

Composite APIs allow developers to access multiple endpoints in a single call. These can be different endpoints of a single API, or multiple services or data sources. This type of API combines different data APIs and services. It is a sequence of tasks that are executed synchronously as a result of the execution, and not at the request of a task. Its main uses are to speed up the execution process and improve the performance of listeners in web interfaces.

<title-2>7 integration ideas for your software tools</title-2>

<Br>

<title-3>Google Maps and Places:</title-3>

<Br>

Google Maps and Places, is the most used location API. They can be easily integrated into your existing application or website to take advantage of Google Maps services. Location APIs are designed to harness the power of sensors and signals of a device to provide users with geographically contextual experiences. These APIs are generated from a combination of several connections and networks from a dozen sources to increase their accuracy.

<Br>

<title-3>Facebook and Instagram APIs:</title-3>

<Br>

Another elementary API in these times is that of social services such as Facebook and Instagram. The Instagram APIs allow us to search for photos by location, users, tags, or to view trend photos and make customized articles. On the other hand, Facebook APIs are divided into Facebook Graph, Facebook Ads, Facebook Atlas, and Facebook Marketing. This helps you get people to see your products and see what's hot.

<Br>

<title-3>Telegram APIs:</title-3>

<Br>

They mainly provide 2 APIs; the first is Bot API, which allows creating programs using telegram as an interface. The second is the Telegram API, where one can customize Telegram as per custom requirements.  

<Br>

<title-3>Amazon S3:</title-3>

<Br>

For development tools, which help to improve the platform we have, the Amazon S3 API provides you the Amazon AWS storage for your APIs, where you can store, retrieve, list, and delete file objects in S3.

<Br>

<title-3>Youtube APIs:</title-3>

<Br>

In the entertainment section, we can use youtube as APIs, you can add a variety of YouTube functions to your application. You can use the API to upload videos, manage playlists and subscriptions, update channel settings, and much more. 

<Br>

<title-3>Gmail API:</title-3>

<Br>

Another API of great interest is Gmail, it allows you to access your Gmail mailbox and allows you to send and receive emails. 

<Br>

<title-3>Google Adsense Management APIs:</title-3>

<Br>

Manage AdSense through this API and create performance reports. 

So, if you want to start using APIs and dal solutions within your company and your consumers -and itâ€™s the time to do so- you should always keep in mind what APIs can be used and to what extent you can use them without breaking the law and create some legal dispute with the company that owns the tool APIs, so we recommend that you look for agencies specializing in the subject and to help you with the integration of an API to your platform, and of course that there is a timely investigation to know how long it will be legal to continue to use within your platform, so you know to start looking for help and power your platform.
