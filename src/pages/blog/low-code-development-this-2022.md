Miami, FL. Feb 21, 2022

To cope with fast-changing market demands, organizations must adopt a strategic approach to iterations such as code-reduced platforms that can be just the boost they need. 

Create systems to make rapid changes to products or business processes and deploy new ones faster. Today **<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/low-code-or-no-code-development"> Low-code </a> (2022)** is one of the most widely used technologies and tools in the world of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/"> software development </a>, but you may be wondering what this is all about and how you can use it to your advantage? Relax, we'll show you how: 

<br>

<title-2>What is low-code?</title-2>

<br>
  
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/low-code-and-no-code-when-to-use-which/">  Low-code </a> is a visual approach to software development that streamlines the entire development process to accelerate delivery. 

With low-code, you can abstract and automate every step of the application lifecycle to simplify the deployment of various solutions. 

By breaking down the traditional enterprise and IT silos, your organization can develop solutions that meet your business needs and enable continuous back-and-forth with the application to meet changing customer demands.

<br>

<title-2>Some Benefits of low-code</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>Decreased costs:</title-3>

<br>

By creating more applications in less time, prices fall. But that's not the only factor. Low-code development reduces the need for more developers, reducing hiring costs. In addition, the right low-code platform can make everyone in the organization - not just IT - more productive. That is an excellent option for saving money and digitizing your company or business.

<br>

<title-3>Better customer experience:</title-3>

<br>

Low-code development doesn't just affect the IT organization. Side effects of increased speed include improved customer experience. 

With <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/low-code-and-no-code-development-vs-traditional-custom-development/"> low-code development </a>, organizations can quickly adapt to changing market or customer needs. Thanks to these flexible tools, you can keep up with your customers, and they will feel welcomed all the time and always come back.

<br>

<title-3>Faster transformation:</title-3>

<br>

In today's digital world, change is necessary. Low-code development takes the complexity out of building modern enterprise applications. And reduced complexity translates into smoother navigation. With these advantages of low-code, organizations are better equipped to adapt and respond quickly to changing business conditions.

<br>

<title-3>Improved agility:</title-3>

<br>

Operating at digital speed means creating the application capabilities users need to function seamlessly across multiple devices. Access to data, collaboration tools, and applications must be equally viable on smartphones and desktops.   

<br>

<title-3>Speeding up development cycles:</title-3>

<br>

Low-code application development lowers the barrier to entry for innovation. People with no coding experience can now create digital products. It is also speeding up development cycles. Can make seamless products and visually appealing designs in minutes instead of weeks. 

<br>

<title-3>Lower maintenance burden:</title-3>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/low-code-statistics/"> Low-code </a> development reduces the burden of software maintenance by abstracting away the tedious day-to-day development work. 

Now that components are standardized, pre-tested, and ready to use, there are far fewer bugs and integration issues to deal with than in the past. 

With less time spent on maintenance, developers can focus on the innovative work that drives more excellent business value.

<br>

<title-3>Visual modeling tools:</title-3>

<br>

It takes less time to design applications with visual approaches and models with code. 

Low-code platforms with visual modeling capabilities use integrated components to represent any data in a way that anyone can understand, from non-technical business users to expert developers.

<br>

<title-3>Drag and drop interfaces:</title-3>

<br>

Drag and drop functionality is available on all known low-code platforms. It is one of the most significant and beneficial elements facilitating the development process. The ease of drag-and-drop functionality during application building helps both citizen and professional developers.

* **IT professionals using low-code to accelerate development:**

It's not just citizen developers adopting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/low-code-and-no-code-as-a-trend-for-custom-software-development-2021/"> low-code </a> development paths. Professional programmers are discovering that low-code development tools can make them more productive. Low-code platforms allow experienced programmers to do more things, but that's not their only benefit. 

It is almost always the foundation of the application, the most basic level of coding, that is streamlined with low-code development. It allows professional developers to spend less time on the basics and more on the advanced levels of coding, which are creative, demanding, and satisfying. 

* **Low-code Supports Entire SDLC:**

Low-code represents a shift in how enterprise software is created. This shift began with simplifying integrated software development environments (IDEs), providing more people with easy-to-use low-code tools. 

In this phase, low-code solutions will cover all aspects of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/low-code-or-no-code-development"> software development </a> more simply through application ideation, solution design, development, user testing, release management, documentation, and more.

* **API-first drives low-code:**

The rise of an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/ideas-to-take-advantage-of-APIs-from-other-platforms-to-generate-useful-software-tools/"> API </a> first world means developers spend less time pursuing broader business goals. 

The software technology landscape is so fragmented that building new functionality such as analytics, messaging touchpoints, and task automation is becoming increasingly complex and expensive. This means we will see greater accessibility of low-code integrations and more excellent connectivity in the digital-first ecosystem, making it easier for developers to go down the buy route to integrate new tools.

* **Developer + Citizen Developer Collaboration:**

In 2022, there will be an inevitable shift in team structure across the industry. 

Collaboration between programmers and citizen programmers will ensure that low-code solutions are productive, not disruptive, as data science-related tasks become even more democratized. 

Rebuilding teams with this type of collaboration and governance in mind will increase productivity for companies large and small.

* **Increased use of pro code:**

The relatively new category of pro-code tools that bring the visual environment and ease of use of low-code into the hand-coding context of the traditional IDE will become increasingly popular with professional developers for solving problems that low-code is not suitable.

Low-code technology has become a hot topic in the business world, and for a good reason. Simple, easy-to-use drag-and-drop interfaces allow anyone to develop business applications without the need for extensive hand-coding. With the ability of any employee in a company to start creating, more processes within a company can be automated faster and to a greater extent, leading to lower costs of operations and overall system improvement. So don't wait any longer and start automating your company or business with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/low-code-or-no-code-development"> low-code </a>.
