Robotic process automation is increasing exponentially, as it is driving massive productivity growth within organizations worldwide. And we are not only talking about an exponential increase in the productivity of people in the company, but we're also talking about efficient information management, tasks, and process automation, customer satisfaction, and higher productivity, among other benefits which make this software trend one of the best options to apply for. Here, we start the travel through our **RPA implementation**. Hope you enjoy it!

<br>

<title-2>Again, what 's RPA?</title-2>

<br>

Robotic process automation, as its name says, is related to the process and task automation commanded by robots (physical or digital) that are programmed to execute, improve or complement human work. 

With RPA implementation we try to eliminate tedious tasks, freeing workers from easy and repetitive labor and let them focus on higher-value work.  

RPA replaces activities, repetitive functions that require a lot of data. It can generate significant cost savings by increasing productivity and process quality, and most importantly, enhance customer experience and improve business results thanks to high-quality and automated processes.

<br>

<title-2>You can get theses benefits by using RPA</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>1. RPA reduces production costs:</title-3>

<br>

One of the biggest advantages of developing software with the help of RPA is that it allows us to reduce staffing costs significantly because once each bot is configured to execute tasks, you don't require a huge team, you use supplies efficiently, you can regulate the flow of inventory, it's less expensive storing information, and you can afford to cut back a little on the funds allocated to claims or problems within the organization because a tool is the one that is going to execute the tasks.

But it's important to emphasize that human personnel will always be needed to keep the system online, and of course, its respective maintenance. 

<br>

<title-3>2. Robots have easy integration to any ecosystem</title-3>

<br>

Bots are used for important, repetitive, but easily impersonated tasks. Integrating a bot into any process, allows you to automate processes little by little, and this allows your company to continue operating smoothly, and reduces clashes with workers, as literally little by little the bots will make their work easier and less misleading. 

It doesn’t need too much code or deep system integration to be operative.

<br>

<title-3>3. As expected, robots reduce human error:</title-3>

<br>

For companies, reducing or eliminating human error is a major plus in today's industry. Not because human effort is not enough, but because today's market requires companies to grow exponentially at an accelerated rate to stay competitive, and while human resources are valuable, they are even more valuable with the right tools to help them perform their functions with less error and waste. RPA is one of these tools, and of course, we add to this list Artificial Intelligence and IoT. 

Thanks to RPA and its integration with software, you can have perfect management of administrative data and information. Information such as invoices, purchase orders, shipments, scheduling of any activity, etc., all can be moved by the robot without any problem. It will get to where the information should be at the right time. There is no space for error because it is programmed for the opposite.

<br>

<title-3>4. RPA brings higher scalability to your ecosystem:</title-3>

<br>

Scalability is of the utmost importance today. RPA allows you to make future changes in your process that is already automated, it's easier to add more processes,  tasks, or even more bots, and improve productivity and finally make the leap to the digital transformation.

You can use on-the-shelf bots and also we can develop them customized for your company. In both cases scalability is possible. Although in custom software development we already know there are more possibilities.

Scalability applies in this case in the opportunity to expand your bots and your digital ecosystem, but also your company will have more scalability in terms of productivity, employee satisfaction, profit, and of course, quality in products and services.  

<br>

<title-3>5. Reduces working time:</title-3>

<br>

RPA bots are able to perform the same actions much faster than humans and do not take breaks. RPA bots can eliminate bottlenecks in a process. Compared to a fully human setup, this could save anywhere from a few extra hours to a few days of work.

<br>

<title-2>Phases we establish to implement a RPA software solution</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>1. Learn:</title-3>

<br>

In this first phase, we introduce you to RPA meaning, benefits, news, and how useful it can be to your company. It's essential for us that you understand why and how we'll implement this technology, so you can be part of the process, even though we are outsourced as a remote team.

<br>

<title-3>2. Identify your current scenario:</title-3>

<br>

Identifying each of the possible solutions that your bot, software, and your digital transformation should have is important, since this way you can cover more processes and get better results. 

We have to deeply understand your needs to solve them and study each one to discover which one is more advisable for your process. Always taking into account the scalability in the future.

<br>

<title-3>3. Select:</title-3>

<br>

We choose the RPA (bots) solutions that we believe are suitable to your processes. If it’s possible to integrate tested options, or if it’s necessary to develop a new solution tailored to your tasks. 

We evaluate the use, criteria, and then (hand by hand) we pick the best option in RPA for you. 

<br>

<title-3>4. Pivot:</title-3>

<br>

Develop, test, and improve everything necessary to develop the ideal software solution. 

This back-and-forth process is what we know as a pivot. Generally, this process is short under our "zero waste" and sustainable development methodology with weekly deliveries and gradual implementation. We make sure we have enough information about your process, and that in combination with our experience and background in the area of software development with artificial intelligence and robotics will make the pivot process as short and efficient as possible. However, it is unavoidable. Every tool that is developed (no matter how simple it is) must be tested in your ecosystem and if it is necessary to correct something, we do it in the shortest time possible. 

<br>

<title-3>5. Measure and QA stage:</title-3>

<br>

By this stage, bots are integrated and we'll be having results in real-time. We document the lessons learned throughout this development, to improve the development process involving RPA in the future. 

<br>

<title-3>6. Expand and scale RPA ecosystem:</title-3>

<br>

If it's necessary to scale your bots ecosystem, we take information from the previous steps, and phases of the development project (all steps and development have been documented) to achieve this goal. 

We believe in long-term partnerships with our allies. We are committed to your goals through time that's why we have this step as part of our successful RPA process.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/robotic-process-automation-rpa-market">   The global RPA market was valued at $1.57 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 32.8% from 2021 to 2028 </a>.  That's why you should start implementing RPA in software development today as a safe and fully efficient solution in each of your processes to automate them.
