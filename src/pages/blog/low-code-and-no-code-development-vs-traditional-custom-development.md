<a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/">  Custom software development </a> is an excellent option to solve the problems that companies are currently exposed to. But there are two types of software development that we perform within our company: **traditional software development and low code and no code development**. 

The decision is up to you, but we can give you a couple of facts about each type of software development, to make your decision easier. 

<br>

<title-2>Let’s compare <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/low-code-and-no-code-as-a-trend-for-custom-software-development-2021/">  low code and no code development</a> with traditional custom development</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>1. Staff and resources for development</title-3>

Usually, depending on the project, companies seek to have more and more skilled and experienced personnel in software development and <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/mobile-apps-web-apps-or-cross-platform-what%E2%80%99s-the-best-for-my-small-business/">  mobile applications </a> to ensure the efficiency of the project, but you will see that this is not always the case:

* **Low and no code:**

Low code or no code development requires fewer people involved in a project because, as their names indicate, the amount of code is smaller. This could mean, for example, that it’s not necessary to have backend developers and frontend developers, server specialists, etc. With a reduced team, you can complete the project successfully.  Depending on the company you contract with, this could mean lower project costs too. 

Also, completing the tech stack of a low code or no code project is easier and requires fewer tools than traditional development. 

Downside: it could be a bit more limited in terms of tooling capabilities, but to be sure we'd need to arrange a meeting and get to know your project scope. 

* **Traditional custom development:**

Custom software development requires a bit more developers and team members, and as you know, it requires more lines of code and framework tools, among others. 

<br>

<title-3>2. Time to market and development</title-3>

<br>

<br>

In the energetic environment we live in today, the development and time to market of an application or software must be as fast as possible, to always stay ahead in this giant industry. Take a look at the following comparison:  

* **Low code and no code:**

The development times with this technology are drastically reduced because it is not necessary to write large amounts of code, and it also reduces coding errors enormously since you mostly have to drag packages of code already assembled.

* **Traditional custom development:**

This kind of development tends to take longer because the programmers have to write long lines of code, and these have to be tested and corrected (if it's necessary) so it does take more time, but it is also more flexible.

<br>

<title-3>3. Cost</title-3>

<br>

<br>

<br>

The cost of development is one of the most important factors and characteristics when executing a project like this. Making an estimation of this or even knowing the cost, we can know how profitable this software or application is in the long term, and estimate profits and losses. Below we show you the comparison:

* **Low code or no code apps**

Low code applications, at first sight, seem to be cheaper to develop than traditional ones, because fewer people are needed, but it all depends on each particular situation. 

Skills and knowledge a little more complete and specialized are required to develop this kind of software.

* **Traditional custom software**

Traditional software applications may be a bit more expensive at first, but in the long run, they can be more economical because they are flexible, you can add functionality or features infinitely, and as we said, low-code apps are a bit more limited, so if you want to make any updates in the future, you will likely need to develop a new tool at some point. 

<br>

<title-3>4. Maintenance</title-3>

<br>

<br>

<br>

The maintenance factor is of utmost importance in this kind of project, since its existence in time and the mitigation of failures depend on it, so the consumers or you have an excellent service, without interruptions.

* **Low code and no code:**

Low code and no code maintenance activities tend to be easier, since you need less <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/methods-to-raise-funds-for-your-startup/">  budget </a>, development infrastructure. Encouraging upgrades and prototyping.

* **Traditional development:**

In traditional custom development projects, maintenance activities are a little bit more challenging,  highly qualified personnel are needed to ensure the success of maintenance activities without interrupting service.

Two sides of the same coin: custom software development. Which one suits you best depends on your project and its speed, economic availability, and scope, among others. 

**At Cobuild Lab:**

We offer you both options. A customized development (traditional), with agile methodologies, so you can develop a functional tool in the shortest time possible, and we also provide the service of low code and no code software development. We even have allies like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.8base.com/">  8base </a> to develop your software solutions with accessible, high-quality tools, and that allows you to enjoy all the benefits of this software development. 

Don't wait any longer to decide which type of software development is best for you. It is a complex task, which can be simplified if you contact us. We will advise you which is more convenient, **low code or no code software development or traditional software development**.
