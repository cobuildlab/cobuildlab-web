<title-2>What Is an API?</title-2>

API stands for “application programming interface.” An API or <a target="_blank" href="https://codecapsules.io/docs/tutorials/creating-and-hosting-a-flask-api/">Flask API</a> is a tool enabling developers to interact with data online. APIs allow web developers to access data through the Internet on various servers and websites by only taking necessary information from the user.  
<br>
APIs need to be hosted on a server to function as an entry point between users and online data. In other words, an API is an interface that retrieves data online and displays it to users. Any time a user accesses a website and inputs data, an API retrieves this data from the server, at which point the API interprets it and sends the requested data back to the user’s device.

<br>

<title-2>Why Are APIs Necessary?</title-2>

APIs are necessary because they act as a layer of protection between users and servers. They access whatever data is needed from the server and give the user only that data. Inversely, they only take information from the user that is necessary to respond to the inquiry.

APIs act as a middleman in <a target="_blank" href="https://guide-rails.io">software testing services</a> so that neither users nor servers need to expose all their data fully. APIs take the required information, perform necessary actions, and present new information.

<br>

<title-2>How to Create an API</title-2>

When creating an API, it is essential to establish the primary goal of the API. When working as a developer to figure out and outline your goals with your API, you should ask yourself the following questions:

- What will the API do?
- Who will it serve?
- Who could benefit from it?
- How can it improve developer and user experience?
- How can it increase accessibility?
- How can this API work for me?  

<br>

After establishing the overarching goal, consider some more technical steps before starting the creation process. Five pillars of designing an API should provide a preliminary roadmap for developers.

- **Usability**: APIs should be accessible for developers to learn and use
- **Reliability**: APIs should have minimal downtime
- **Scalability**: APIs should be able to handle increased loads during usage spikes
- **Testability**: API testers should be able to point out defects quickly
- **Security**: APIs should protect against hackers and fraudulent users

When making more technical decisions, these should be considered while creating an API and working on the framework.

<title-3>Software</title-3>

Before starting, developers need to download the necessary software to enable API creation. Some of these include:

- <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com.br/books?hl=en&lr=&id=lhnADwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=flask+API&ots=Jw0LiwCJ7o&sig=4Q2YDe2CCJvLUhALbtDGHCSvlRw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=flask%20API&f=false">Flask API</a>, which is the web development framework for Python
- Gunicorn, which is a WSGI server that aids the Python application
- Requests, which is a Python library that is used to interact with APIs  

In addition, baseline knowledge of coding, especially how to push codes from a local repository to a remote repository, is strongly encouraged.

<title-3>Deciding on an API Style</title-3>

There are two main API architectural styles: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Satish-Thatte/publication/239553871_Simple_object_access_protocol_SOAP_11/links/54489e4e0cf2f14fb8142a59/Simple-object-access-protocol-SOAP-11.pdf">SOAP</a> (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer). REST is far more popular among developers. More than 70% of public APIs use this format because it is more straightforward, performs better, and has greater scalability than SOAP.

<title-3>Security Measures</title-3>

If an API is poorly designed or neglects proper security measures, there are many negative consequences, including inept authentication, important unencrypted data, and data leaks, to name a few.

There are many essential security layers to incorporate into an API. Four of the more critical layers that most high-functioning APIs includes are:

<title-4>Monitoring Who Can Access an API</title-4>

API keys are vital for this. They can identify users who access an API and detect malicious behavior.

<title-4>Authentication Practices</title-4>

There are many options for authentication software that confirm users’ identity, usually by requiring login information and a password before accessing the API.

<title-4>Functionality Limitations</title-4>

Even authenticated users need limits on what they are and are not allowed to do within a specific API, including what data they can access. Many software options aid with activity monitoring.

<title-4>Data Encryption</title-4>

Encrypting data makes it unintelligible to users who are not authorized to access an API, which prevents hackers and unauthorized users from taking data that does not belong to them.

<br>

<title-2>Constructing the API</title-2>

Building an API starts with standardizing responses.

<title-3>Standardizing Successful Responses and Error Messages</title-3>

Error codes and corresponding messages let users know if the requested data is accessible, can be found, or authorized for their access. Error message descriptions should inform the issue but should not reveal any additional information like names of servers or frameworks. You can use an API gateway for this.

<title-3>Creating an API Endpoint</title-3>

An endpoint represents one end of a communication channel in an API, typically defined as a URL. With the REST structure, endpoints can contain various HTTP methods, such as:

- **GET**, which allows resources to be accessed directly from the database
- **POST**, which is used to create a new resource in the database
- **PUT**, which is used when the whole help needs to be updated
- **PATCH**, which is used to update only a specific part of a resource
- **DELETE**, which is used to delete a resource

<title-3>Writing API Documentation</title-3>

Documents should give developers all the information they need to use an API, including authentication scheme, the definition of endpoints, interfaces, and error descriptions. This information will make their experience more manageable and allow them to use the API to its fullest capabilities.

<title-3>Creating the API</title-3>

Developers will need to create a Python environment using Virtualenv. After installing the necessary software, activating the terminal will allow information to be put into the API. This data is often drawn from other existing APIs, as it is a compiled database.

<br>

<title-2>Conclusion</title-2>

Through coding with appropriate endpoints, you can set up the API. You can learn more from the various tools available on specific software testing services and codebases that many developers use.

Developers must write code that allows users to retrieve information by creating corresponding endpoints to direct the server to the correct data points.
