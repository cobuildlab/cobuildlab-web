<title-2>What is a custom CRM?</title-2>

<Br>

A Custom CRM is a software used by companies to improve the interaction with customers, allow companies to organize, optimize, and synchronize all interactions with customers and analyze data throughout the customer life cycle. The purpose is to improve customer service, better understand customers, and improve internal processes.  

Given that companies have different methodologies, processes, and products, their problems are often different, so it is recommended that companies use custom CRM for specific solutions. Custom CRM software is profiled and implemented to meet your specific requirements. Flexibility lies in the selection of processes that require automation and in the access of departments to a particular set of information.

Developing custom software offers you the opportunity to adapt your CRM to your problems throughout the process chain. This will help you get, without a doubt, more concrete results. By doing this you will not lose your money by paying a license for a commercial CRM that might not solve your problems later on. Similarly, this can be scalable, and be adapted quickly, and there is even the possibility of adjusting the solutions so much to you that no commercial CRM will be a rival.

CRM integration means that your system can connect to your website or a third-party service to exchange data seamlessly.

As your business grows and you improve your products, your problems grow, and you may have new ones that you have never seen before, but don’t worry, custom CRM software can be modified over time, either to increase the capacity of one of its functions or simply to add a new tool or feature that allows you to solve that new problem.

<title-3>Data Security</title-3>

Custom CRMs tend to be more secure than a commercial open source CRM, open-source CRMs can be good in their functions but the source code can be seen by many people and can be used with bad intentions. The website created on these platforms can be hacked "en masse" if the wrong person gains access to the code and database.

There are two ways you can develop a CRM for your company.  You can use a  commercial one that can be customized, meaning that you can activate the functions that you need more, and deactivate the remaining ones so that they are not an obstacle at the moment of using the software. But this option is limited in the long term because you can't add new functions that are not in the package if you require them in the future. On the other hand, we have the second option that is the most recommended, which is to develop your customized CRM, strictly adjusted to your needs and requirements, and with the ability to modify it as you please in the future. 

You already know what a CRM is and the benefits of implementing this software in your business, so don't get left behind, and start looking for help to develop your custom CRM and take your business to another level. This way you will be able to connect better with each of your customers and identify them better.
