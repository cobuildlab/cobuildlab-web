Miami, FL. Dec 05, 2021

In this day and age, software development must be sustainable, and that’s because the current market compels us to be much more efficient, reduce development errors, optimize teams and workloads and of course reduce delivery times, so this kind of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/services/custom-software-development">  software development </a> must be agile. 

As time goes by, more and more companies are opting for this development methodology, to guarantee total success in the software release, and harmony in their work teams. Let’s go over the basics about **sustainable software projects with agile methodologies**:

<br>

<title-2>Definition of sustainable software</title-2>

<br>

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/importance-of-sustainable-software-in-custom-project-development/"> Sustainable software </a> is an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/"> agile software development </a> methodology that seeks to improve software development activities to provide a better service.  

This development methodology is based on dividing the project into phases and completing them little by little. This way, confusion is reduced and it is guaranteed that what the client asks for is what will be delivered. 

In the same way, the progress is tested at the end of each stage and its behavior is studied along with the client and corrections are made in situ. So, no work is left unfinished and the software is assembled with its functions correctly.   

It is important to highlight that this development methodology must be combined with agile development and frameworks to guarantee its total success and faster delivery to the customer.

<br>

<title-2>A few reasons why you should start using sustainable development in your software projects</title-2>

<br>

<title-3>* Cost-saving:</title-3>

<br>

This type of development allows customers and companies to save a lot of money since they only pay for what is already developed, completed, and successfully tested, they should not pay more for something they do not need, and that makes the best option for those looking to develop something of quality at a very good price. 

<br>

<title-3>* High scalability:</title-3>

<br>

Thanks to these developments the software has a greater facility to adapt to new problems that may arise during the development process or later, since it is assembled in stages and allows to add new functions or simply eliminate them, in order to be specifically what the customer needs. 

<br>

<title-3>* Shorter delivery times:</title-3>

<br>

As we have already mentioned, this software is developed in different cycles, and this facilitates the work of developers as they focus the whole team towards the same goal and can work faster and more efficiently. 

By delivering faster, the customer is more satisfied and the company profits much sooner.

<br>

<title-3>* Reduce wastage:</title-3>

<br>

Waste is avoided in terms of what is developed, with the whole team working for the same purpose. 

Likewise, at the end of each stage the function is tested, and if there is something to discard it is done at the time and ready. This usually contributes to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/10-ways-to-increase-the-productivity-of-your-team-in-2020/">  productivity </a> and efficiency.

<br>

<title-3>* Improve communication:</title-3>

<br>

With this agile methodology, a clear and flawless communication channel is established between the client and the development team right from the start.  This is the only way to guarantee a successful project. 

<br>

<title-2>Why is sustainable software developed with agile methodologies?</title-2>

<br>

Agile methodologies help to carry out successful and sustainable software development. 

For this kind of project, agile methodologies such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.scrum.org/"> SCRUM </a>, Kanban, and Extreme Programming are taken into account.  

These methodologies facilitate the development process:

* There is rapid feedback 
* Paired programming is encouraged
* Integration tests are carried out
* Frequent publications
* Regular constructions
* Short development cycles
* Quality is promoted
