Imagine a tool that can help you code faster by suggesting autocomplete your code! The [software developers](https://www.cobuildlab.com/blog/tips-to-choose-right-custom-software-development-company-for-your-business/) spend most of their time coding, which is time-consuming and sometimes mentally draining. You can now code quicker and achieve more thanks to machine learning and AI.

Businesses also want solutions that help them analyze customer feedback better and tailor their services to them. In this regard, GitHub Copilot can help developers and enterprises utilize [sentiment analysis](https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/building-a-no-code-toxicity-classifier-by-talking-to-copilot) AI through machine learning models.

This article explores the power of incorporating a Github Copilot.

<title-3>What is GitHub Copilot?</title-3>

GitHub Copilot is an [AI programming assistant](https://github.com/features/copilot) that helps developers code faster while putting in less work. Github describes the product as an AI pair programmer that reads the comments and context of code and gives developers coding suggestions.

Copilot is a product of collaboration between Github and OpenAir. OpenAI's Codex system powers it. Codex has been trained from billions of publicly available code repositories on GitHub to understand source code and natural language. It draws knowledge from its rich base to make code suggestions. And this makes Codex arguably more potent than GPT-3 in code generation.

The large dataset from which Codex is trained gives Copilot an upper hand in knowing how developers code. As such, it can produce better code suggestions.

<title-3>Github Copilot Availability</title-3>

Github launched Copilot in June 2021 as a technical preview. However, the company has now made Github Copilot available for all developers. But it is not free! The AI pair programmer is available at a monthly \$10 or \$100 annual subscription. Nevertheless, Copilot is freely available for verified students and top contributors of open source code.

GitHub Copilot is offered as SaaS (Software as a service) and is available as a downloadable extension for coding. You can use it on coding tools such as Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim, and Jet.

Additionally, Github supports common programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and Go.

<title-3>How GitHub Copilot Works</title-3>

Github Copilot relies on the context of your code to predict and autocomplete your code lines. When you start typing code on the Github Copilot editor, the extension reads and relays your code line and comments to the Copilot service. It learns the context by accessing the file you\'re editing and the related files within the same project.

It will then analyze the datasets it has been trained from and try to find the most suitable code for your context. Its functionality instantly suggests individual lines and whole functions of codes. As you write your code, the AI will analyze your coding cues and autocomplete your code with possible suggestions.

Better still, Copilot gives multiple suggestions so you can pick the one that matches your code. If none of the suggestions interests you, you can let it generate more recommendations until you get a completion that makes sense.

Creators and developers have found Github Copilot to work better with repetitive text because you let it autocomplete the code. It is a great tool to help you learn new programming languages.

<title-3>Does GitHub Copilot Write Perfect Code?</title-3>

Although Github is a perfect developer tool, it doesn't write perfect code. It tries to understand the context of your file and project and predict the best. However, sometimes it spits outputs that do not make sense. This confusion may arise from the AI not understanding your inputs or commands, or maybe it hasn't yet learned that particular code.

If you want to get better results from Copilot, it is advisable to break your code into small functions and provide parameters and docstrings that are easy to understand. If you keep your comments simple, the tool will quickly understand the context and generate meaningful code.

Plus, Copilot does not test the code suggestions it makes, so it might not always be functional. The developer must test and verify the authenticity of the generated code just like any other code.

<title-3>The Benefits of Github Copilot</title-3>

So, is the hype about Github Copilot in the developer\'s world worth it? The answer is simply yes. Though Copilot doesn't generate perfect code, it comes with benefits that make the developers\' life much easier. Here are some of the top benefits of incorporating Github Copilot:

<title-4>Github Copilot reduces Distractions</title-4>

Github is a fantastic tool for developers. It helps you focus on the flow of your project flow. Therefore, developers can speed up their processes and boost their productivity. This is critical for a business that wants to rely on sentiment analysis to analyze customer data and provide better customer service.

<title-4>Copilot Helps in Tackling Repetitive Tasks</title-4>

Another critical benefit of Github Copilot is helping developers complete repetitive coding tasks faster and with less effort. When you incorporate Copilot in your processes, it will learn your coding style as you feed the code and comments. And as you progress, you will find that the tool figures out the context and auto-fills repetitive code with better accuracy.

<title-4>Pushing Developers To Better Document Code</title-4>

Copilot helps developers improve their code documenting techniques. As mentioned earlier, Github works better when the code lines and comments are kept simple. And as you progress using the tool, your overall coding skills improve tremendously. The code document is not only accessible for Copilot to create more accurate completions but also makes the code more accessible for you and others to read and improve.

<title-3>GitHub Copilot Doesn't Replace Human Developers.</title-3>

Will Github Copilot replace human developers? NO! Copilot is an assistant, just as the name suggests. It cannot write an entire code on its own at the click of a button. The user is still in total control to get better results. After all, you must test and verify the code to ensure it works. Rather than replacing developers, Github Copilot makes them more productive and happier with their work.

<br>

<title-3>Final Thoughts</title-3>

The future of coding is brighter, thanks to AI tools like Github Copilot. This machine learning AI is extensive for developers and businesses alike. It complements developers' skills and improves their creativity in creating business solutions that work. And most importantly, Copilot can help with sentiment analysis that aids businesses in understanding their consumers' behavior and offering them satisfactory services.
