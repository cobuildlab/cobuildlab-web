        The initial plan for developing the app was created by the 8base executive team, Albert
        Santalo and Oscar Perez. Carlos Arevalo worked on the technical designs and wireframes of
        the application, and Cobuild Lab led the architecture and development of the platform. When
        Cobuild Lab joined the project, we began having weekly meetings to define the priorities and
        the strategy that we would use for creating the product. During these meetings, Bob and
        Jerry’s practical know-how was directly taken into account when developing features which
        they wanted to manage inside the application, and from there early designs and proposals
        were created to solve each of those features that were needed.

        Approach

      <DetailParagraph>
        One of the reasons why Cobuild Lab was brought to the team was for our extensive experience
        building web applications, especially with the ReactJS framework, which is a core element in
        the 8base stack.

        to market an innovative new system that is cost-effective and improves strategic alliance
        performance. We carefully investigated development alternatives including existing “no code”
        vendors. 8base was the only company that could equip our subject matter experts with
        powerful and agile tools to deliver a solution that will be capable of scaling and evolving
        with collabtogrow™ itself.”

        After dozens of alpha product iterations, we are excited to present the first full version
        of the platform. Almost a year later we have created an amazing dynamic. between all the
        participants on the project.
      </DetailParagraph>
      <DetailParagraph>
        Early in the development process, we started with bi-weekly meetings for creating all the
        basic features, once we started creating more specialized features and powerful tools we
        decided to meet 3 times a week to have a more iterative approach solving small pieces at a
        time, creating more agile and efficient development cycles.
      </DetailParagraph>
      <DetailParagraph>
        During these meetings, we discussed along with Bob, Jerry, Oscar, and Carlos the features to
        be developed, the business requirements, and how this should be implemented in the product.
      </DetailParagraph>
      <DetailParagraph>
        Carlos was in charge of creating the visual representations of the features, validating
        those ideas with the team, which would be implemented in the following weeks.
      </DetailParagraph>
      <DetailParagraph>
        During the later sprints, another development team was added in order to complete the more
        robust features to the platform in a timely manner, those features included the “balanced
        scorecard”, a summary view of the status of the alliance designed by the collabtogrowTM
        team; and a powerful “reports system” to query real time data and analytics, both unique
        values of how collabtogrowTM handles the process of strategic alliances. Technology Stack To
        develop the product we used the 8base Platform, which is a complete set of backend tools to
        enable Frontend developers to create amazing products faster. This also included the 8base
        boost kit, a ReactJS components library focused on simplicity, 8base Graphql API and Cloud
        Functions, Auth0 as an authentication provider, and SendGrid for email notifications. During
        the development over 6 Cobuild Lab developers participated in the coding process, all
        frontend specialists on Javascript and ReactJs.
