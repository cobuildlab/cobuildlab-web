        How everything <TextOrange>started:</TextOrange>
      </DetailSubTitle>
      <DetailParagraph>
        The idea comes from Alejandro and Juan Carlos. Juan Carlos is the owner of Best Miami
        Weddings and for years he has had problems keeping track of how his workers report hours,
        because the applications on the market don&apos;t work for him. Alejandro, his director of
        marketing and technology proposed this idea about building a web and mobile platform custom
        made to its needs, and so the project began.
      </DetailParagraph>
      <DetailParagraph>
        Alejandro has known <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alacret/">Angel Lacret</a> , Chief
        of Product Development at <a href="https://cobuildlab.com/">Cobuild Lab</a> for about 6
        years now from working together in a software company and in 4Geeks Academy. Sánchez gets in
        touch with Lacret so that he can put a team together and start developing this project
        together with them. After several iteration, the concept was expanded to create a complete
        marketplace for the industry, where employer can publish their position needs to a wider
        audience.
