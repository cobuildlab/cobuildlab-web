      <DetailParagraph>
        The real challenge lies in the restrictions arbitrarily imposed by the Venezuelan government
        on some print, audiovisual and digital media, including El Pitazo, which website is
        currently blocked throughout the national territory.

            We had to develop a software solution capable of overcoming all the restrictions imposed
            in Venezuela and that would also have a user-friendly interface with an eye-pleasing
            design and a very intuitive{' '}

            .

          <ListItem>
            Since El Pitazo is a digital news media, it was crucial that the product simultaneously
            displayed the same information posted on the web platform.

        The <TextOrange>Solution</TextOrange>

      <DetailParagraph>
        Taking the above into consideration, we put together a team of the best developers, QA
        Analysts, and a Project Manager to create a roadmap to find the most suitable solution for
        the project. Due to restrictions in the country were carried through the domain as well as
        through the IP address, it was virtually impossible to implement a solution so people could
        have access to the platform with no problem.

      <DetailParagraph>
        El Pitazoâ€™s audience is segmented into Venezuelans living in the country, Venezuelans living
        abroad, and foreigners interested in the news related to this country; which led us to find
        a proper solution for them. We then decided to build a{' '}

          Mobile App
        </TextLink>{' '}
        that would be compatible with both Android and iOS Operating Systems, since it was almost
        impossible for the Government to restrict an App, and this would allow users who live in the
        country to have full access to all the news by just downloading the App.

            Since the web platform of El Pitazo was built using the{' '}
            <TextLink to="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</TextLink> development tool, we were
            able to extract the information from the website and transfer it into the app using
            either of two methods:
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Making a scrapper of the website, which is a programming technique that allows us to
            extract information from any website.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Obtaining the data from the portal through the{' '}

            The Project was developed with the JavaScript programming language, using the

            we used the Node.js tool with the Express framework in the server part for the
