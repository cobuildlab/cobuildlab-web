In the next release, the capabilities of making payroll will become available. 

For the talent, the mobile app allows them to get notifications for open positions, apply, and full fill the shift and track payments all in one place.

<title-4>How everything started:</title-4>

The idea comes from Alejandro and Juan Carlos. Juan Carlos is the owner of Best Miami Weddings and for years he has had problems keeping track of how his workers report hours, because the applications on the market don't work for him. 
Alejandro, his director of marketing and technology proposed this idea about building a web and mobile platform custom made to its needs, and so the project began.

Alejandro has known [Angel Lacret](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alacret/), Chief of Product Development at [Cobuild Lab](https://cobuildlab.com/), for about 6 years now from working together in a software company and in 4Geeks Academy. Sánchez gets in touch with Lacret so that he can put a team together and start developing this project together with them.
After several iteration, the concept was expanded to create a complete marketplace for the industry, where employer can publish their position needs to a wider audience.

The app was built with React Native, mainly for IOS. At this point, Jobcore is in the process of development, testing products, and tools that facilitate its purpose, which is to help you in yours. Stay tuned for more updates of this project.
