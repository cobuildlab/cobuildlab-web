        The <TextOrange> Problem </TextOrange>
      </DetailSubTitle>
      <DetailParagraph>
        Patients require support. When talking about therapeutic adherence, there is a tendency to
        blame the patient for not following medical orders without taking into account the
        determinants related to the health system that can significantly affect therapeutic
        adherence. The reality is that therapeutic adherence is a very dynamic process that requires
        a continuous tracking and improvement approach; interventions must be adapted to the
        patients and for this, it is essential that professionals are trained in therapeutic
        adherence as they should be able to assess the patient{"'"}s willingness to comply with what
        is indicated, advise on how to do so and follow the patient{"'"}s process every step of the
        way.
      </DetailParagraph>

      <DetailParagraph>
        Like any process, when the first stages are not fulfilled, the rest of the system is always
        affected to a greater or lesser extent. When the patient goes for consultation, he/she
        receives a series of steps to follow, either laboratory tests, imaging studies, or
        consulting with other specialists; when this fails to happen, a chain decline develops; that
        is, if there are fewer and fewer patients who follow medical indications, then fewer and
        fewer laboratory tests are performed, fewer imaging studies, fewer consultations; this
        results in higher costs of maintenance of equipment, reagents, health care staff, and a
        lower rate of income in these areas of the system.
      </DetailParagraph>

      <DetailParagraph>
        In a parallel way, we can also appreciate that the patient doesn{"'"}t take the necessary
        tests to guide to an adequate diagnosis and subsequent treatment, which results in a
        worsening of his condition, becoming in many occasions a chronic condition, which will
        represent an increase in health costs a posteriori as well as a progressive and silent
        deterioration of the patient. The healthcare system is facing new challenges and Avsee seeks
        to be the tool that facilitates its evolution in order to successfully face them.

          Custom CRM (Customer Relationship Manager) Software.
        </TextLink>{' '}
        A CRM software is part of a customer-oriented strategy (in this case patients) in which all
        actions have the ultimate goal of improving the attention and relationships with customers
        and prospects; therefore using a CRM tool will allow healthcare providers to easily share,
        track and maximize the information about a given patient, its treatment, and thus understand
        their needs and anticipate them.
      </DetailParagraph>
      <DetailParagraph>
        Since the platform would handle high traffic of information, we decided to use a{' '}

        </TextLink>{' '}
        method to allow data to be accessed from basically any device with an internet connection,
        and by using this cloud-based model we aimed to lower down costs and improve effectiveness.
        Now, the cornerstone of this project was to ensure the data safety; since organizations that
        will use this platform work the PHI (Protected Health Information), it was imperative to
        make Avsee HIPAA-compliant.
