                <p>
                  Protecting customer data represents a challenge for organizations. Our team{"'"}s
                  custom databases help them organize and protect their records, while network
                  infrastructure security enhancements prevent data from falling into the wrong
                  hands. We{"'"}ve helped thousands of registries stay secure and hundreds of
                  organizations comply with digital compliance.

                <b>GDPR Compliance</b>
                <p>
                  The EU{"'"}s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is one of the most
                  comprehensive government-imposed data privacy frameworks implemented to date. It
                  went into effect in May 2018 and is meant to protect the data privacy of EU
                  citizens. However, this compliance regulation doesn{"'"}t just apply to European
                  companies; anyone who processes the data of European citizens required to comply.
