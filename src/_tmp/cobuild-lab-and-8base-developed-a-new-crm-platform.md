Miami, FL. Nov 20, 2020 - Earlier this year the partnership between Cobuild Lab and 8base to develop a new platform was announced and now it’s in the final stage of development. <br> </br> 

Besides being a sponsor of our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Miami-Software-Developers/?chapter_analytics_code=UA-105326682-2"> Miami Software Developers</a> group, the  8base team joined forces with Cobuild Lab to develop a new platform. “We are glad to work with such a talented and dedicated team as 8base” comments <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alacret/"> Angel Lacret</a>, Chief of Product Development of Cobuild Lab. <br> </br>

The new platform named Lead Volt is a very specific CRM for the automotive insurance industry. CRM or Customer Relationship Management is an application that allows centralizing in a single database all the interactions between a company and its customers. <br> </br>



<title-4> What’s a CRM? </title-4> <br> </br>

A CRM is a program or application in which all the conversations that anyone in a company has with a client, whether it's are emails, calls, or meetings, are automatically saved in the file of that specific client. This file is accessible to everyone in the company; internal notes and/or activities with a date to be done can be placed on these conversations, assigned to a team member, thus improving the overall productivity. <br> </br>

Companies that implement CRM solutions can:  <br> </br>

* Increase productivity: gathers all processes and business information in one place available to everyone in the company   <br> </br>

* Makes it easier to manage each sales process and emerging opportunities  <br> </br>

* Create new sales opportunities   <br> </br>

* Collect information for Sales Managers and Sales Executives  <br> </br>

* Update budgets in real-time optimizing sales processes <br> </br>

The platform will allow Lead Volt to share and maximize the knowledge of a given customer and thus understand their needs and anticipate them.  *“Of course, we are using the Backend-as-a-Service offered by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.8base.com/"> 8base</a> since it allows us to develop a solution to manage three basic areas on the Lead Volt platform: sales management, marketing, and after-sales or customer service,”* said Lacret. CRM software allows us to segment a customer base, so it also makes it easier to plan sales and marketing strategies more effectively and increase revenues. <br> </br>

We are getting prepared to launch its <a target="_blank" href="https://cobuildlab.com/blog/minimum-viable-product/amp/">MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</a> and try out all the features that were added. Stay tuned for more updates about the Lead Volt project and thank you so much for reading.  <br> </br>
